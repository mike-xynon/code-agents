Corporate Actions Market Practice
1 Background

December 2022

This document presents the US Market Practice for Corporate Actions in accordance with the US business rules for corporate action events.
The directives in this document present the standards unanimously agreed to by member organizations of the ISITC Corporate Actions Working Group. The standards collectively comprise the US Market Practice that organizations are committed to adhere based on Corporate Actions business rules.
ISITC has been designated by the Global SMPG organization to act as the representative for the US Market. Any changes to the market practice require review and approval by the ISITC Corporate Actions Working Group.
1.1 SCOPE
The Market Practice document will cover the complete lifecycle of a Corporate Action from the notification of an event through instruction processing (where applicable) and the final confirmation of payment. The Corporate Action business processes in this document are outlined according to corporate actions business rules. This document is now the sole document for all market practice regarding the Corporate Actions event lifecycle. The ISITC Corporate Actions Working Group will maintain this US Market Practice document as it relates to specific Corporate Actions business rules.
This document does not cover specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between parties communicating corporate action messages that may differ from the market practice.
1.2 DEFINITIONS
The terms to be defined in this section are in progress and will be ready for a future release of the document.
1.3 ACTORS AND ROLES
Roles: the functional role played by a business actor in a particular business process or business transaction.
Actors: the organization playing the role.
In order to effectively communicate corporate action information in the market, Roles and Actors have been identified to highlight the information flow between the sender and receiver of corporate action messages. The Roles and Actors will be referenced in diagrams throughout the document and are defined as follows:
Role 1 ­ Event Initiator: The party who is authorized to announce and relay details of the corporate action event to the market.

2 Business Definition

December 2022

2.1 BUSINESS DATA REQUIREMENTS
The ISITC Corporate Actions Working Group fully endorses the SMPG Consolidated Event Interpretation Grid "EIG" for the placement and use of data elements. The EIG contains requirements for the events supported in each market, the relationship between the event type and the mandatory / voluntary indicator, the relationship between the event type and the applicable options associated with the event, as well as presence of rates, dates, periods, and prices that are critical for each event. The EIG also highlights the global standard and tracks exceptions where a market may deviate from the global standard. The EIG is posted on the SMPG website, www.smpg.info, in Public Documents > 2. Corporate Actions > A. Final Global Documents > SMPG_CA_Global_Market_Practice_Part_2.
2.2 MARKET PRACTICE RULES
2.2.1 Corporate Action Announcement
2.2.1.1 Announcement Flow US Market Practice supports the following announcement flow:
· A new announcement message is sent the first time the event is communicated to the Entitled Party.
· Replacement messages are sent throughout the lifecycle of the event as Corporate Action (CA) details are updated. Replacement messages must link back to the previously message sent. It is assumed that the account servicer will generate updated notices once the internal system(s) detects a change in the corporate action event information.
· Replacement messages for position changes are optional and determined by Service Level Agreements between the Service Provider and Entitled Party.
· Reminder messages are optional in the flow and are sent to inform the Entitled Party that all or a portion of their eligible balance is uninstructed.
· Note: ISITC submitted a proposal to move the Reminder of uninstructed positions from the Announcement flow to the Processing Status flow for Instructions. SMPG is in agreement with the concept; however official changes to the Announcement flow have not been accepted at this time.
· Withdrawal of Event versus Cancellation Request ­ Withdrawal of Event is used to notify the recipient that the offeror has withdrawn the event from the market. Cancellation Request is used to notify the recipient that the previous announcement message sent has been cancelled.
· Bulk (aggregate) messages can be used when reporting multiple accounts for the same event. Bulk messages will not contain resulting entitlements. These are optional in the flow and can be provided based on Service Level Agreements between the Service Provider and Entitled Party.
· Details that are relevant to the Event/Offer as a whole are to be reported at the Event Level (i.e. ex date, offer period).
· Details that are specific to an option or can vary by option are to be reported at the Option Level (i.e. option code, response deadline).

13

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

· Details that are specific to the outturn of the event/option are to be reported at the Movement Level, (i.e. share ratio, resulting entitlement, pay date).
· The default option is to be identified for Mandatory with Choice events. It represents the account servicer's default option that may not be the same as the Local Market Agent or Company's default.
· Optionally the service provider may provide information on cash in lieu servicing by the agent, beneficial holder round-up after a mandatory event has been processed or paid out.
· Additional Information - The market practice is to use structured fields to communicate notification details. Free format text is to only be used when a structured filed does not exist.

2.2.1.2 Official Corporate Event Reference ID DTCC is the official entity in the US market to establish the COAF for US events that are DTCC eligible. Effective November 2011, DTCC started communicating the COAF on ISO 20022 Corporate Action Notification (CANO) and Corporate Action Cancellation Advice (CANC) messages. In October 2010, the ISITC Corporate Action Working Group approved a COAF Recommendation Paper regarding guidelines for DTCC to follow when establishing the Event Reference ID for the US Market. Please refer to www.isitc.org for the document.
When the Official Corporate Action Event Reference ID is announced, it is expected that the ID be reported on all CA messages in the lifecycle of the event. Please refer to section 3.2.1.1 General Information for further message details.
Guidelines:
· Multi listed securities ­ recommendation to have a unique COAF for each listing. Corporate Action details may differ across markets.
· Multi staged events ­ recommendation for each event to have a unique COAF. Recognize challenge whereby the Issuer will announce a Rights Issue consisting of a distribution of rights and exercise of rights. From a processing perspective these are two separate events.
· ISITC follows the SMPG guidelines for the COAF (www.smpg.info )

2.2.1.3 Entitlement Process - This process will be defined in a future release.

2.2.1.4 Market Practice Guidelines for US Events The following section details Market Practice guidelines that apply to specific US Events.
2.2.1.4.1 Rights Offers
The US Market processes Rights Offers as two separate events. The two events must be linked to each other either using the Official Corporate Action ID or by linking the processing IDs to each other:
1. Rights Distribution as a mandatory event

14

Corporate Actions Market Practice 2. Exercise of Rights as a voluntary event

December 2022

2.2.1.4.2 Redemption Events 2.2.1.4.2.1.1 Lottery
The US Market supports Lottery Events. Please refer to Appendix for Guidelines for Lottery Event Processing for the US Market including a sample message flow.

2.2.1.4.2.2 Partial Defeasance and Partial Pre-refunding Redemption Events
Effective with SR2015, two Additional Business Process Codes FPRE (Full Prerefunding) and PPRE (Partial Prerefunding) have been introduced to differentiate events involving the Corporate Action Event type PDEF.
A PDEF event with the Additional Business Process indicator of FPRE indicates that the event is a Full Prerefunding. A Full Prerefunding Event by definition is "The exercise of a privilege by the issuer to repay, in full, any debt security prior to maturity when the issuer deposits assets in trust. This irrevocably restricts their use to satisfaction of the debt". This event differs from a Partial Defeasance or a Partial Prerefunding which both use the PDEF CAEV code in that the event is being fully redeemed.
A PDEF event with the Additional Business Process Indicator of PPRE indicates that the event is a Partial Prerefunding. A Partial Prerefunding event by definition is "the exercise of a privilege by the issuer to repay, in part, any debt security prior to maturity when the issuer deposits assets in trust. This irrevocably restricts their use to satisfaction of the debt. New securities are issued for the portion prerefunded and the portion which is non-refunded". This event will involve a lottery whereby the "affected" position will move to the new refunded CUSIP with an earlier maturity than the underlying CUSIP. The "unaffected" position will move to the non-refunded security and will maintain the same maturity date as the event security.
Please note that a PDEF event without the use of an Additional Business Process Indicator relates to a Partial Defeasance event. This event by definition is "Issuer sets aside cash in escrow to pay off a portion of the issue before the maturity date. New securities are issued for the portion defeased and portion non-defeased. Similar to a Partial Prerefunding, the event involves a lottery and moves affected position to two new CUSIPS for the Defeased and Non-Defeased balances.

2.2.1.4.2.3 New Security Issuance Indicator field usage for Partial Prerefunding and Partial Defeasance Events
New Security Issuance Indicator for Partial Defeasance and Partial Prerefunding Events

15

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

Effective With SR2015, two codes have been introduced within the New Securities Issuance Indicator field within the Securities Movement Section of the CANO and CAPA (MT564) and CACO (MT566): REFU (Refunded) and NREF (Non-refunded). These indicators are to be used with the event type PDEF for Partial Prerefunding events. Based on lottery results, positions for a Partial Prerefunding event are moved to two new securities and thus use the New Securities Issuance Indicator.

Called position from the lottery are moved to a Refunded CUSIP with an earlier maturity date than the Underlying Security. The new security will have a New Security Issuance indicator of REFU.

Position unaffected by the lottery will be moved to a Non-refunded CUSIP with the same maturity date as the underlying CUSIP. The new security will have a New Security Issuance Indicator of NREF.

Effective with SR2014, the New Security Issuance indicator field will be utilized for Partial Defeasance Events to differentiate the new securities which are being issued. A Partial Defeasance event is where the issuer sets aside cash in escrow to pay off a portion of the issue before the maturity date. The event CUSIP will be debited and two new securities will be issued, one for the defeased CUSIP which will use the New Securities Issuance Indicator Code DEFE. The non-defeased CUSIP will use the NDEF value.

2.2.1.4.2.4 Principal with Interest Payments Principal with Interest Payments apply to mortgage backed securities where a portion of the principal payment is decreased "pay down" or increased "pay up" in addition to an interest payment. The nominal value of the instrument is not affected by the pay down or pay up of principal.
· Factors are used to calculate the value of the outstanding principal of the instrument. In 2011, the market practice for announcing these events has been changed to a two event model. This change will be effective with the implementation of the DTCC Reengineering initiative.
1. Principal "pay down" or "pay up" will be announced as ISO Corporate Action Event code PRED ­ Partial Redemption without the reduction of nominal value.
2. Interest will be announced as ISO Corporate Action Event code INTR - Interest Payment
The US market follows the SMPG recommendation for Redemption events. Please refer to the Redemption Matrix included in the Global Market Practice Part II document posted on www.smpg.info.
2.2.1.4.2.5 Return of Capital The US market supports both Return of Capital events (Event Code CAPD) and Capital Gains Distribution events (Event Code CAPG). There are scenarios where multiple payments are distributed within a single event. In this case, the multiple payments are announced as one event (i.e. short term capital gain, long term capital gain, etc.). When a dividend is announced with a capital gains distribution, the dividend is considered a separate event.

16

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

2.2.1.4.2.6 Bankruptcy
There are generally three stages to Bankruptcies in the US. Each stage is considered a distinct and separate event. They are described as follows:
· Stage One ­ Initial Bankruptcy Filing. This is a mandatory event for informational purposes. Event type (BRUP/MAND)
· Stage Two ­ Vote on Bankruptcy (Proxy) or Vote Plan of Reorganization. This is a voluntary event where the distribution of cash and/or securities and the plan is to be approved or not approved by shareholders. Event Type (BRUP/VOLU)
· Stage Three ­ Potential mandatory distribution(s) of cash and/or securities based on the outcome of the bankruptcy.

2.2.1.4.3 Name Changes In the US Market a Name Change can result in one of the following:
1. New resulting Security ID (CUSIP) and maintain original name of security 2. Maintain Security ID (CUSIP) and new security name 3. New resulting Security ID (CUSIP) and new security name
Corporate Action Notification message will be sent to announce the name change regardless of the result. The appropriate Corporate Action Event Indicator and Change Type Indicator will be supported. Corporate Action Confirmation messages will be sent when there are security movements resulting from the event (for scenario 1 and 3 above).

2.2.1.4.4 Tender and Exchange Offers with multiple cash movements
Some Tender and Exchange Offers on fixed income securities or debt instruments can have multiple cash movements/payouts for one or more options. The different cash movements represent the following payouts; principal amount (may be above par), consent fee, early participation fee and accrued interest. This also is consistent with how the payments will be made. In these scenarios, there will be one option with multiple cash movements on the message.
For example, Option for Cash (CAOP//CASH) with the following movements:
· one cash movement for the principal payment (including premium above par) · one cash movement for the consent fee · one cash movement for the accrued interest

2.2.1.4.4.1 Dutch Auction
A US Dutch Auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a security. Holders of the security are invited to make an offer to sell, within a specific price range. The acquiring party will buy from the holder with lowest offer.

Dutch Auctions typically have a maximum and minimum price range at which holders are allowed to tender their shares. This is declared using the Minimum Price (MINP) and Maximum Price (MAXP) price and bid interval (BIDI). For example, Minimum Price of $10 and Max Price of $25 with a Bid Interval of $5. Effective for SR2021, these fields are available in Sequence D or Sequence E with a network validation rule that they cannot appear in both levels. US market practice is wherever possible to output at sequence E because there could be different option ranges (Min, Max) or intervals for a given event.

Also introduced for SR2021 is the concept of Bid Range Type. There are three potential values: Divisible (DIVI), In Multiple (MULT) and Incremental (INCR).

Divisible means that all values including the Min or Max price are divisible by the Bid Interval. e.g. · Minimum Bid Accepted is $10.30, Maximum Bid Accepted is $11.20 and the Bid Interval 0.10.  $10.30  $10.40  $10.50  $10.60  $10.70  $10.80  $10.90  $11.00  $11.10  $11.20

Multiples means that the Minimum or maximum price is not divisible by the bid interval but successive values are in multiples of the bid interval. e.g. Minimum Bid Accepted is $10.32, Maximum Bid Accepted is $10.92 and the Bid Interval $0.10  $10.32  $10.40  $10.50  $10.60  $10.70  $10.80  $10.90  $10.92

Lastly, Increments means that the bid range values are in increments from the minimum to the maximum price, but no values are divisible by the Bid Interval. e.g. Minimum Bid Accepted is $34.15, Maximum Bid Accepted is $35.05 and the Bid Interval = $0.10.  $34.15  $34.25  $34.35  $34.45  $34.55  $34.65  $34.75  $34.85  $34.95  $35.05

For complex Dutch Auction or Bid Tender events, two new fields were introduced First Bid Increment and Last Bid Increment in SR2022. This would be the first Bid Price after the Minimum or before the maximum price. These were specifically introduced to handle the case when there are irregular bid ranges. For example, Min Price 10.22, Max Price 10.62 with Bid Interval 0.10. The First Bid Increment could be 10.30 and the last Bid Increment could be 10.60 . This eliminates the uncertainty of whether the first price should be 10.30 or 10.32 or whether the Last bid increment is 10.60 or 10.62

The concept of Bid Range type and First and Last Bid increment type are recommended to help reduce the possibility of a rejected instruction due to a bad bid price.

Within a Dutch Auction event, for some bonds there is a different concept using basis points. Dutch Auctions on bonds have a minimum and maximum basis points spread (also known as a Bid Spread Range), for example from 75 to 115. A basis point refers to 1/100th of a percent. Elections are submitted using basis points in the bid spread range. When announcing the event using basis points, the election responses are required to be submitted using basis points.

Effective with SR2014, a new format option of 92P for Bid Interval Rate (BIDI), and 90L for Minimum Price (MINP), Maximum Price (MAXP), and Generic Cash Price Received per Product (OFFR) were introduced to communicate the applicable details in the basis points format starting with the announcement and throughout the event lifecycle. Prior to this change, these details would appear in narrative text thereby impacting STP and introducing risk of misinterpretation. Please refer to Appendix for Guidelines for Dutch Auction Event Processing for the US Market including a sample message flow.

2.2.1.4.5 Automatic Dividend Reinvestments on Unit Investment Trusts (UIT)
Some Unit Investment Trust instruments automatically reinvest principal and interest proceeds. The market practice is to announce this as a mandatory event under the Dividend Reinvestment event code (CAEV//DRIP with CAMV//MAND). This one event will contain both the principal and interest portions of the reinvestment.
For example, Option for Securities (CAOP//SECU) with two movements: · one securities movement for the interest portion being reinvested · one securities movement for the principal portion being reinvested
Other Unit Investment Trust instruments do not offer a reinvestment feature. Dividends on these securities follow the Mandatory Dividend with Cash structure (CAEV//DVCA with CAMV//MAND).
2.2.1.4.6 Cash Dividend Distribution with an Automatic Reinvestment (Opt-out)
Certain securities (e.g. closed-end funds) announce cash dividend events where the CSD facilitates an automatic reinvestment of the dividend into additional shares of the fund.
The market practice is to announce these events as Cash Dividends with an option (CAEV//DVCA with CAMV//CHOS). The default option is SECU. An instruction is required to opt-out of the default option for the event (i.e. to receive something other than SECU).

2.2.1.4.7 Cash Dividend Distribution with Option to Elect into a DRIP Program According to the Issuer, the events that are DRIP eligible in the US market are: Cash Dividend (DVCA / CHOS)
19

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

Capital Gains Distribution (CAPG / CHOS) Return of Capital (CAPD / CHOS) Interest Payment (INTR / CHOS) Partial Redemption (PRED / CHOS)

These events are announced with an option to reinvest. The default option is CASH. DTC in concert with the securities agent/issuer, offers an elective reinvestment program to reinvest the cash into securities.

Effective with SR2014, to support US market practice, a reinvestment indicator was added to help distinguish these Dividend Distribution DVCA events from regular cash dividends, currency options, and true optional dividends. The new Reinvestment Indicator REIN is available in Seq D Tag 22F DIVI//REIN. The REIN Indicator will allow the receiver of the corporate action announcement to identify that a reinvestment feature exists for the distribution. A security option (SECU) will be present in addition to the CASH option. This also applies to Capital Gains, Interest, etc. (any distribution event that has a reinvestment feature).

Effective with SR2016, a new code for Special Dividend with Reinvestment code has been added to identify the case where there is a special dividend with a reinvestment feature. The new code is available in Seq D Tag 22F DIVI//SPRE.

2.2.1.4.8 Dividend with Options
These events are dividends with two or more options related to the form of entitlement (CAEV//DVOP with CAMV//CHOS) ­ options may be for either CASH or SECU; and there may be multiple CASH or SECU options. These events do not indicate a reinvestment through the Action Level indicator. The default option is defined for each event.

2.2.1.4.9 Cash Distribution from Sale of Non-Eligible Securities
Effective with SR2012, a new event code, DRCA was added to appropriately announce a cash distribution from the sale of non-eligible securities (generally on ADRs). Prior to this new event code, these events were being announced as dividends or other events.
ADRs are negotiable certificate issued by a US bank representing a specified number of shares in a foreign stock that is traded on a US exchange. ADRs are denominated in US dollars with the underlying security held by a US financial institution overseas.
The holder(s) of the ADRs may still be entitled to the corporate action proceeds or privileges that may occur on the underlying foreign stock. The corporate actions that take place on the foreign stocks may directly translate to the ADR holders, be translated into another corporate action, or have no direct effect on the ADRs.
20

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

One example of a corporate action on the underlying foreign stock translating into another corporate action is a Rights Issuance to shareholders.
· Rights issuances give the stockholders an additional security that entitlements them to purchase new shares issued by the corporation at a predetermined price.
· ADR holders may not be entitled to the rights issued but may still receive proceeds on the sale of the rights in a foreign market by the ADR issuer.
· One reason the ADR holders may not be entitled is if the Rights were not registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, therefore we were not permitted to pass the Rights on to the holders of Depositary Receipts ("DRs").
· The ADR issuer then distributes the proceeds from the sale of Rights issued to the ADR holders and the ADR holders never receives the Rights securities. Additional fees may accompany each transaction.
· On the sale of rights corporate action ADR fees are generally included. There is also the potential for withholding tax being withheld from these proceeds.

2.2.1.4.10 Class Actions
In the US Market Class actions can be announced as Mandatory or Choice events. When it is mandatory event it is for informational purposes only.
In 2009, the ISITC Corporate Actions Working Group (CA WG) formed a Class Action Sub Group to establish market practice - classification of event and options associated with Class Actions.

2.2.1.4.11 Proxy
This document does not address Proxy Voting. A separate suite of proxy messages are approved and available in the ISO 20022 format.

2.2.1.4.12 Tax on Share Distributions Taxability on share distributions needs to be communicated at two points within the lifecycle of the event:
1. At the time of the announcement 2. At the point of payment
Taxability on shares can be categorized under a few processes: · Non-taxable distribution of shares · Taxable distribution of shares - share ratio reflects net amounts (after tax)
21

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

· Taxable distribution of shares - withholding tax paid at point of distribution by paying cash · Taxable distribution of shares - withholding tax paid in the future by paying cash · Taxable distribution of shares - withholding tax obligation covered through second corporate event
(i.e. cash dividends)

Non-taxable distributions typically do not mention any tax obligation and it's assumed the share distribution is non-taxable. For taxable distributions, the announcements should highlight that tax will be applied.

There are a few different scenarios:
1. If tax is to be withheld at the point of distribution ­ a. The announcement message could quote a cash debit to highlight a tax obligation that will need to be paid by holders at the point of distribution. Including the cost debit date will also allow clarity around the timing of the debit, further enhancing shareholders ability to manage their cash flows. There is limited detail available within the cash movement to highlight how the value was calculated, as such; the share movement would still need to be leveraged. Also, utilizing a cash debit would allow the flexibility of communicating payable dates that are different from the credit date of the share distribution.
2. If tax obligation is deducted from the share distribution ­ a. Resulting in share distribution at a net rate versus gross rate. The message could highlight the tax obligation within the share movement and not include a cash debit.
3. If tax obligation is deducted from another event's proceeds (i.e. cash dividend) ­ a. The message will highlight that the event is taxable; however, the tax will be covered through the second event.
2.2.1.4.12.1 Withholding Rates & Exemption Types Transactions that involve multiple FATCA and NRA withholding tax types are on income paid on corporate action events. Tax withholding that is applied is dependent on various upstream decision factors such as income qualification (type of income), source of income (country), type of client (entity), residency of Beneficial Owner etc., and type of tax appropriate for the distribution considering various decision factors.
For example:
· US Source Income ­with majority being announced in US, however can apply to non US Markets · Dividend Distribution · Non US intermediary
22

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

US Withholding Agents and non US Foreign Financial Institutions must apply the applicable tax: either NRA or FATCA, depending on the type of certification and documentation the non US intermediary client has provided.

A 30% tax rate is the applicable for FATCA, however it can also be the applicable NRA tax rate. When the tax is applied, communicating to the investor the type of tax that will be applied important for payment transparency and can provide for further STP in the payment lifecycle. If there is no tax applied, the investor can recognize the exemption via exemption codes that IRS has specified for FATCA or NRA.

Effective with SR2014, new Withholding Type Codes were added to comply with FATCA regulations to identify the reason for the withholding and to provide transparency to identify the type of withholding tax being applied: FATCA, NRA, or Back-up Withholding as required in the market. Effective with SR2016, the US Market Practice is to use the following Withholding Type Codes:
· FATCA Withholding ­ FTCA 92a::TAXR//FTCA/0,30
· NRA Withholding ­ NRAT 92a::TAXR//NRAT/0,30
· Backup Withholding - BWIT 92::TAXR//BWIT/0,28
In addition, with SR2016, the Exemption Type code ETYP/IRSX and Income Type Code ITYP/IRSX can be used in both the securities and cash movements, Subsequence E1 and E2, Tag 22F. The field is repeatable. In the case where there is no tax applied, ETYP is to be used to communicate the Exemption Type Code the IRS has specified for FATCA or NRA. Please refer to Appendix for the complete list of valid Withholding Tax Exemption Type Codes for the US Market.

2.2.1.4.12.2 Issuer / Offeror Taxability Indicator Effective with SR2016, a new data type was introduced to the "Issuer / Offeror Taxability Indicator' data element to support the U.S. requirement to be able to characterize the taxability of events and the associated cash and share proceeds that are being paid.
The taxability of an event is sourced through the life cycle and is a necessary data element to complete end to end processing (announcement to payment). Although data elements are available to communicate the actual rates (example TAXC), this additional taxability indicator will enable to communicate the tax consequences. Tax information is sourced and announced by the issuers, depositories, and custodians.
This new indicator must allow users to reconcile tax consequences and the impact to expected corporate action proceeds earlier in the business process. This taxation may reduce the proceeds, result in a withholding tax obligation at the point of distribution, or highlight the eligibility for tax reclaim and reporting taxable proceeds.
23

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

Although most distributions are subject to tax, this new taxability indicator allows users to highlight there is a tax exceptions associated with the specific distribution. The taxability indicator is applicable to all corporate action events and all types of payments (cash and/or shares).

Unique payments (cash and/or shares) within a corporate event may have unique tax classifications. As each of these payments may or may not be subject to tax, the taxability indicator at the movement level allows for clarity per payment.

The implementation of this new taxability indicator in the ISO Standards led to the creation of an element with a code list limited to a single code (TXBL for "Taxable").

Please refer to the SMPG Corporate Actions TXAP Taxability Codes Market Practice Usage Guide for complete details.

2.2.1.4.13 NIL Payment Processing
Definition of NIL Payment: When a security is not going to make a scheduled payment, for example, when a market practice or requirement exists to report/announce a dividend on a regular basis and the company chooses not to pay the dividend for that period. NIL payment is considered a final status until advised otherwise.
Standards Definition / Usage of NILP: MT564 CA Notification Message (MX equivalent 20022 CANO)

Seq E 92K::GRSS or INTP/NILP Seq E2 92K::GRSS or INTP/NILP

Nil Payment - Rate will not be paid Nil Payment - Rate will not be paid

Usage Rule - Rate Type Code NILP (Nil Payment), available for use with rate qualifier GRSS (Gross Dividend Rate) and INTP (Interest Rate Used for Payment), can only be used with Corporate Action Event Types :22F::CAEV//DVCA (Cash Dividend) and :22F::CAEV//INTR (Interest Payment).

Seq E1 90E::OFFR/NILP Seq E2 90E::OFFR/NILP

Nil Payment - Price will not be paid Nil Payment - Price will not be paid

Scenario for NIL Payment:

Scenario
1. Scheduled payment not received (no default notice)

Comment
Event is still valid in the market (previously announced/confirmed rate and pay date). The issuer or agent will not be making the scheduled payment and not considered to be in default.
Or, the company deferred the scheduled payment the next scheduled payment.

Recommended Process Flow · Update CA Notification message with NILP to provide information that the payment will not be made.
· If Pre-advice message was sent, a cancelled pre-advice must be sent.

2.2.1.4.14 Bulk Announcement

The US Market supports Bulk (aggregate) messages.
· Bulking of notification messages is used when reporting multiple accounts for the same event for an account owner.
· The benefit of Bulk Announcements is to reduce the number of MT564 and MT568 messages received by the account owner.
· The account information can be repeated in bulk notification · Bulk messages do not contain resulting entitlements. · Bulk messages are optional in the flow and can be provided based on Service Level Agreements
(SLA) between the service provider and account owner. · Linking of bulk messages will follow the general linkage principals, please refer to section 3.2.2.2
Sub sequence A1 Linkage. · Bulk notification messages do not contain entitlement information therefore, an SLA is needed to
identify when the service provider will revert to individual messages once the entitlement stage has been reached for certain event types. · For example, in the US market, DRAW events must revert to individual messages once the lottery stage or certificate based call has been determined since these messages will contain resulting entitlements.

2.2.1.4.15 Guidelines for creating multiple notification messages
It is sometimes necessary to create multiple MT564 messages and/or create multiple MT568 messages for a Corporate Action notification. This section details the guidelines/standards for creating multiple MT564 and MT568 messages for a notification and how to split the data amongst the messages.
Creating multiple messages within a notification is necessary when all the information for a notification causes the MT564 and/or MT568 message to exceed the message limitation of 10,000 bytes. The most common data scenarios that would necessitate the creation of additional MT564 and/or MT568 messages are:
1. A large amount of narrative text information. 2. A large number of Accounts reported on the notification (a Bulk Announcement). 3. A large number of Options for the event. 4. Any combination of the above.
It is recommended to use this logic to determine when to create additional messages and the data to appear on each message.
1. When an MT564 message exceeds the message size limit, the narrative text should be moved from the F sequence of the MT564 message to one or more MT568 messages. More than one

26

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

MT568 message may need to be created to communicate all the narrative text and keep the MT568 message(s) within the message size limit.
2. If the MT564 message still exceeds the message size limit, some account sequences should be moved to one or more additional MT564 messages. All other data within the MT564 message (i.e. Corporate Action data) should be the same in all MT564 messages created for this notification.
3. If the MT564 message has a single account sequence and still exceeds the message size limit, some option sequences should be moved to one or more additional MT564 messages. All other data within the MT564 message (i.e. Corporate Action data) should be the same in all MT564 messages created for this notification.
4. The Function of message (field 23G) should be the same in the MT564 and its associated MT568.

All messages created for a notification should follow the linking guidelines. Please refer to the 3.2.2.2 Sub sequence A1 Linkage section for complete details.

2.2.1.4.16 Best Practice for Communicating When an Offer Is Not Accepted or Prorated
For the events where instructions are not accepted (Bid, Dutch Auction, etc.), Notification details must be updated with the results of the offer. Account Owners who did not have their instruction accepted, should receive an Instruction Status Message indicating their election is rejected.
For events that are subject to pro-ration, the account owner's original instruction is still valid, however, the resulting entitlement will be different. In this case, the Service Provider would update the Notification details with the pro-ration information. The instruction is not rejected.
2.2.1.4.17 Additional Business Codes Partial Put Redemptions
Effective with SR2015, the Additional Business Process Code PPUT (Partial Mandatory Put Redemption) has been introduced in order to differentiate BPUT (Put) Events in the US Market that involve a lottery. The Usage of the PPUT indicator along with the BPUT Corporate Action Event Type indicates that the event is a Partial Mandatory Put. Within this event, a lottery is used as an additional business process used to determine eligibility for the BPUT event. Once eligibility from the lottery is achieved, the Partial Mandatory Put event may or may not involve an option to retain the Underlying Security. For events without the option to retain, holders will be cashed out based upon their called position. For events with the option to retain, holders can elect to retain their underlying security or be cashed out.
2.2.1.4.18 Shareholder Rights Directive Indicator
Effective with SR2020, the Shareholder Rights Directive Indicator, SRDC, was introduced to indicate whether the event announcement was initiated by the first intermediary in the custody chain in accordance with SRD II. Refer to the SMPG SRDII Global Market Practice document for details of usage.
27

Corporate Actions Market Practice

2.2.1.4.19 Tax On Non-Distributed Proceeds Event and Indicator (TNDP)

Effective with SR2020, new market practice principles have been created to provide guidance to process TNDP events. Refer to section 9.29 in the SMPG Global Market Practice ­ Part 1 document for detailed information on this.

2.2.2 Corporate Action Confirmation of Payment
2.2.2.1 Payment Confirm Flow
US Market Practice supports the following Confirmation of Payment flow:
· The Corporate Action Payment Confirm is sent by the Service Provider to the Entitled Party. · One Payment Confirmation is sent per account for the share and/or cash outturn resulting from a
specific option. · Bulk Payment Confirmation is not supported. · Multiple share and/or cash payments can be confirmed on one Payment Confirm message as long
as they result from the same option and have the same posting date. · Due to the timing of when payments are made, it is possible that more than one Payment
Confirmation will be sent per account per option. For example: in the case of an Exercise of Rights, the payment of cash must be made prior to the receipt of the securities. One Payment Confirm will be sent when cash is debited from the account and a second message will be sent when the securities are credited to the account. · Reversal Payment Confirm message must contain the same data as the original Payment Confirm. Only the posting date of the reversal will be different. Partial reversals are not allowed. The reversal must be for the total amount originally posted. · Reversal Payment Confirm messages must link back to the original Payment Confirm message. · Details that are relevant to the Event/Offer as a whole are to be reported at the Event Level (i.e. ex date, offer period). However, it is not required market practice to repeat all event details on the Payment Confirmation message as they are reported on the Announcement message. · Details that are specific to the confirmation are to be reported at the Confirm Level (i.e. option number, option code). However, it is not required market practice to repeat all option details on the Payment Confirmation message as they are reported on the Announcement message. · Details that are specific to the payment of shares and/or cash for an option are to be reported at the Movement Level (i.e. posting amounts, posting date, value date). · Additional Information is not supported on the Payment Confirmation message as this will have an impact on STP.

2.2.3 Corporate Action Instruction
2.2.3.1 Instruction Flow US Market Practice supports the following Instruction flow:
· One Corporate Action Instruction message must be sent for each account, for each option of an action.
· Bulking of Corporate Action Instructions is not allowed.

28

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

· If it is necessary to amend a previously sent instruction (this includes changes in election or a decrease in the share position) it will be necessary to send a separate cancellation message on the instruction you wish to cancel and then a new message for the new instruction. Two Corporate Action Instruction messages are required, one to cancel and then another for the new instruction.
· Cancellation instructions must be a cancellation of the original instruction in its entirety, partial cancellations are not allowed.
· If it is necessary to instruct on an increased share position for a specific option then a new message will be required for the additional share amount.
· These guidelines do not incorporate usage of the Corporate Action Instruction message for NRA tax reporting.
· Instructions must be sent on or before account servicer's response deadline date and time.
· Effective with SR2016, two separate corporate action instruction messages must be sent for the exercise option and the oversubscribe option.
o The standard no longer supports the submission of one corporate action instruction for the exercise option and oversubscription privilege
· Special requirements may apply when submitting oversubscription instructions. Refer to Appendix for additional details regarding oversubscription instructions.

2.2.3.2 Option Numbering ­ Clarify usage of CORP vs. COAF The ISITC CA WG is addressing the risk associated with Corporate Action option numbering. The option numbers reported on the MT564 Corporate Action Notification are not announced by the issuer and therefore represent service provider proprietary information. Account owners receive different option numbers across multiple providers for the same event.
To help mitigate the risk, the ISITC CA WG recommends for account owners to utilize information within the Instruction Sequence to distinguish options from one another. Therefore, the group recommends processing off of additional data elements within the instruction message to achieve STP. The presence of Option Number (CAON) is mandatory in the message; however in the case when an account owner does not support service provider proprietary information, it is acceptable to use "999."
In the case of events where the option codes are different, the option code is sufficient to match the option to achieve STP.
· For example: Optional Dividend the options are Cash (CASH) and Securities (SECU). The option number is not necessary to distinguish between the options, the option code accomplishes this.

In the case of events where the option codes are the same type, the account owner must provide the data elements that distinguish the different options. This will reduce the risk of misinterpreting instructions, clarify intent of the election, and increase STP with the service provider.
· For example: Cash Dividends with Currency Options there are multiple options for CASH (i.e. GBP, EUR, and USD). The currency of the option being selected is the distinguishing factor between the options and must be provided.

29

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

The Corporate Action Instruction message supports data elements for event and option identification to help facilitate STP. ISITC recommends criteria for instruction matching to identify the event and ensure uniqueness to the option being elected by the account owner.

2.2.3.2.1 Recommended matching criteria for instruction processing

Event Identification

Mandatory fields:

1. Corporate Action Event Reference ID ­ COAF (when announced in market) or CORP (if have) or "Nonref"
2. Corporate Action Event Type Indicator CAEV 3. Account Number

The following additional data elements should also be used:
4. Security Identifier 5. Place of Listing 6. Account Number 7. BIC code of sender

Option Identification
Mandatory fields:
1. Option Number (CAON) or "999" 2. Option Code (CAOP) 3. Quantity of shares being elected on (QINS)

The following additional data elements are used to uniquely identify the option being elected when applicable based on the event details:
4. Currency Option (OPTN) 5. Resulting Security ID (ISIN) 6. Price (OFFR or PRPP)

Further Identification

30

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

Use Instruction Narrative (INST) for the cases where additional information is needed to provide uniqueness of an option, clarify intent of instruction, and uniquely identify the event. For example:

1. Market deadline date (to distinguish between options that have different deadlines) 2. Offeror Name (for competing offers) 3. Specified Price or Unspecified Price 4. Conditional or Unconditional 5. Cash Rate

The ISITC CA WG recognizes that the Instruction Message does not support all possible data elements to distinguish between options of the same type. However, the recommended approach accounts for a majority of the Instruction volume. The group is moving forward with requests for improvements to the ISO standard to support additional data elements that distinguish options to increase STP. These data elements exist on the Corporate Action Notification Message.
2.2.3.3 Best Practice for Cancel and New Instruction Processing
Cancel and new instructions are communicated individually. Best practice is to send the cancel instruction before the new instruction and populate the linkage sequences. In situations where the expiration date of the offer is the same day that the account owner is communicating a cancel and new instruction, it is recommended that the account owner also follow up with the Service Provider directly.
2.2.4 Corporate Action Processing and Status Advice
2.2.4.1 Status and Processing Advice Flow
US Market Practice supports the following Status and Processing flow:
· One Corporate Action Instruction Status Advice must be sent for each Corporate Action Instruction received. Bulking of response status advice is not allowed.
· The only time a CA Instruction Status Advice will not be sent for a CA Instruction is in the case when the entire event is cancelled. When a CA Announcement for the Withdrawal of an event is sent, it is not necessary to also send CA Instruction Status Advice messages to confirm that instructions logged against the event are also cancelled.
· Multiple reason codes can be sent on a single CA Instruction Status Advice. · The CA Instruction Status Advice should be used to confirm receipt of a CA Instruction. Account
owners should accept the CA Instruction Status Advice as confirmation of their CA Instruction. · The CA Instruction Status Advice should be sent to provide status of new instructions as well as
cancel instructions. · The CA Instruction Status Advice must be linked back to the CA Instruction. Multiple CA
Instruction Status Advice messages reporting different status/reason codes can be sent for a single CA Instruction.

Recommended ISITC Market Practice: · Please see illustration below regarding the usage of AFTE, BEFO, WITH to clarify when to process the messages. · Also used when linking multiple 564 messages sent in one transmission, i.e. Bulk Notifications.

The linkage sequence MUST be present when transmitting multiple MT564/MT568 messages in order for the recipient to follow the messages in the chain.
The first message needs to contain linkage to identify that there are other messages following in the chain.
There are two options:
1. Forward link to the next message in the chain by using 22F::LINK//WITH or AFTE (depends on where the message is in the chain 13A::LINK//564 or 568 (whichever applies) 20C:: RELA//SEME of the next message to be processed with Please note, the standards definition for RELA needs to be updated to support usage in the forward linking scenario. This is recognized as the only case ISITC would support RELA on the notification message.
2. If forward linking to the SEME of the next message in the chain is not technically possible then use 22F::LINK//WITH or AFTE (depends on where the message is in the chain) 13A::LINK//564 or 568 (whichever applies) 20C:: CORP//xxxx (to let the recipient know that there are more messages to follow that need to be processed)

39

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

For all subsequent messages in the chain, the linkage should always identify the messages that are to be processed together
· 22F::PREV//SEME of previous message in the chain · Forward link to the next message if applicable

For Replacement (REPL) messages, the first MT564 will link back to the previous MT564 message sent
· 20C::PREV//SEME of previous MT564 · If multiple MT564 and MT568 messages are needed, the same rules as above apply

Cancellation messages would follow the same linkage flow, however, the function of the message would change to 23G::CANC for the MT564 and MT568.

Optional
Recommended ISITC Market Practice: · PRFC identifies the factor that was applied to the previous redemption/payment date. · NWFC identifies the factor being applied to the next (current) redemption date.

3.2.2.3.1 Illustration of Factor Reporting

Recommend the following usage for factor reporting using the MT564 messages:

SECURITY NUMBER:

31341HCN3

SECURITY TYPE:

FREDDIE MAC

PREVIOUS FACTOR: .00171928

Factor used to calculate the April 15th payment & May 15th payment

CURRENT FACTOR: .00162643

Factor published on May 4th & used to calculate the May15th payment

NEXT FACTOR:

.00153293

Factor published on May 4th & will be used to calculate the June 15th payment and may not be known at the time of the announcement

POSITION LEVEL: .00009285

Is the difference between the previous factor (.00171928) and the current factor (.00162643) which will be used to determine the current payment for May 15th.

.00009285 is multiplied by the face value of the security to determine the May 15th payment. The client needs to know the previous factor (was used for April 15th) and current factor (which is being used for May 15th) to determine the rate used to calculate the May 15th payment. The current and next factor will be used in cash projection and for cash modeling purposes to determine the next payment on June 15th.

POOL LEVEL: The client will use the previous factor to determine what percentage of the loan has been paid off. If the security was 10 million when issued in the market and the client only purchased 1 million, the previous factor allows the client to calculate and determine what portion of the original pool has been paid. This allows the client to complete accruals and market analysis.

42

Corporate Actions Market Practice

December 2022

Note: In SR2006 Current Factor (CUFC) was removed from the message. The agreed upon method to report this is as noted below.

Based on the above illustration, the mapping of factor information is a follows:
· 92C:PRFC//0.00171928 (value of factor from previous payment) · 92C::NWFC//0.00162643 (value of factor for current payment)

The standard does not support a value to represent current factor. Therefore, the market practice recommendation for the 564 Notification is to map the current factor value to the NWFC qualifier.

3.3.1 D vs. E Guidelines ­ Placement of MT564 and MT566 Data Elements ISITC follows the SMPG EIG Consolidated Matrix for the preferred placement of data elements for Date/Time, Period, Rate and Price Fields. Differences between the US market and the global standard are identified in the US column. Please refer to this document on www.smpg.info.
ISITC supports SMPG recommendation for usage of Unknown (UKWN) for Rate, Date, Period, and Price date elements when the details are not available at the time of announcement but will become known during the life of the event.
Clarification on use of Unknown versus Ongoing for Pay Date:
· First come/first serve events with multiple payment dates are considered "ongoing" and represented as PAYD//ONGO.
· For events with a single payment date that is "unknown" at the time the announcement is sent, use PAYD//UKWN.

3.3.2 US Market Income Type Codes ­ Updated 2022 US Income Type Codes are used with the IRSX Data Source Scheme. Field 22a::ITYP is available in the MT564 and MT566 in both the Securities (E1/D1) and Cash (E2/D2) movement subsequences.

Since there are situations where both a US and foreign (non-US) Income Type code could be applied for the same movement, as from SR2022, new OTYP (Other Type of Income) qualifier was added in the MT564 and MT566 messages. When multiple Income Type codes are applied for same event and same movement, the recommendation is to place the US IRSX code in 22a::ITYP.

As ITYP qualifier is not repeatable, the other non-US jurisdiction (such as CRAX Income Type codes in Canada) should be placed in field 22a::OTYP. When multiple non-US Income Type codes are to be applied to same event and same movement, OTYP is repeatable and other Income Type codes may be used (such as HMRC for UK and Ireland).

For complete list of global Income Type or Exemption Type codes, please refer to SMPG document at: https://smpg.info/fileadmin/documents/1_Corporate%20Actions%20WG/A1_CA_Final_Market_Pr actices/6_ETYP-ITYP_Exemption_IncomeTypeCodes_v1_1.pdf

* Note that REDM/MCAL should also be used when making the final payment for a fixed income security that has paid-down in part during its term. E.g. even though a pool factor security would partially redeem capital using the event PRED, the final payment should nonetheless be sent using REDM/MCAL to demonstrate that it is the final paydown on the security.

Note that the table above has been created to clarify the events for the following CAEV codes: · BPUT - put redemption

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

· CAPI - capitalisation · DRAW - drawing · MCAL - full call/early redemption · PCAL - partial redemption with reduction in nominal value · PRED - partial redemption without reduction in nominal value · PRII - interest payment with principal · REDM - final maturity
The Complex Grid outlines that BPUT events are initiated by holders and are classified as 'VOLU'.

The remaining redemption events are part of the terms of the underlying securities and are classified as 'MAND'.

· PEND is used when the instruction's processing is pending. The instruction can then be either accepted for further processing or denied.

· PACK is used when the instruction has been accepted for further processing.

· When status is IPRC/REJT, account owner is expected to reinstruct or to cancel and reinstruct, based on SLA. and LATE).

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines 3.3.7 MT565 Oversubscription Instruction Guideline

December 2022

Effective with SR2016, two separate corporate action instruction messages must be sent for the exercise option and the oversubscribe option. The standard no longer supports the submission of one corporate action instruction for the exercise option and oversubscription privilege.

3.3.7.1 Assumptions · None

3.3.7.2 Recommended Approach
The approaches differ depending upon whether the offer requires over subscription elections to be submitted at the same time as the exercise instruction or not. The following matrix outlines the possible formatting options available:

3.3.7.4 Example 1: Generate two MT565s, one for the exercise and another for the over subscription, with each message linked to the other
In this example it is required that the account owner link both messages to each other and that the account servicer considers the linkage requirements as part of their automated STP solution.
If the linkages are not present then there is an increased risk that the over subscription instruction may not be executed at the same time as the exercise and thus the account owner may NOT receive the oversubscribed shares given the processing requirements associated with the event. This could occur

due to varying circumstances, e.g. exercise is processed STP but there is a problem with the oversubscription instruction requiring manual intervention.

If using the format for the scenario where exercise and over subscription instructions must be submitted at the same time, it is the responsibility of the account owner to alert the account servicer, via another means or narrative within the message, that an over subscription instruction is to follow. This will help to reduce the risk associated with sending this type of formatted message in this scenario.
The above requirement is not needed for the scenario where the instructions can be sent independent of each other.

3.3.8 Best Practice Guidelines for reporting Stock Loan Balances
This section details out the guidelines / standards for communicating on-loan positions on the MT564, MT565, and MT566 messages. Only relevant sections of the message are detailed here to support the guideline.

To help understand the different Securities Lending relationships that can exist between Service Provider and Account Owner, the following diagram was taken from the ISITC Lending Model Market Practice Document.

Securities Lending Models are broken down into two main categories:

1. Custody Lending (when the custodian and the Lending Agent are the same entity) 2. Non-Custody Lending (when the Custodian and the Lending Agent are different entities)

Note: The recommendations in this section are in the context of the Non Custody Lending Model. If an arrangement between the Custodian and the client exists where the Custodian is tracking the client's loan activity, the guidelines outlined should be followed.

Notes:: Third Party providers may have models where securities are first delivered to an omni-account before actual delivery to a broker. This is a custody consideration (custodian may want to consider sub-custody agreement) but from a non-custody lending standpoint it should not change transactions or workflows.

Third Party Agent ­ (a) Specialist, (3rd Party) (b) Custodian,

Client Best Practice: Should always be an SLA between Custodian and Lending Agent

Notes:: Client is referenced as a non-custody lender only in situations where the client is lending securities that are managed by the same parent entity as the client. If they are lending assets that are not part of the same parent entity then they are considered a third party or specialist lender to the various participants

ISITC Considerations: Same as in "Custody Lending" + message communication/interactions between Direct Participants

Definition

Comments

Total balance of securities eligible for this corporate action event. The entitlement calculation is based on this balance.

Balance of eligible securities that is in a loan nominee (third party securities lending or custodian securities lending nominee) and should be returned if the Custodian is required to make the necessary election on behalf of the account owner.

Balance of securities representing only settled transactions; pending transactions not included.

SETT would reflect the total position that is settled and available. This would exclude positions in LOAN nominee.

Balance to which the payment applies (less or equal to the total eligible balance).

If CONB is equal to ELIG, then payment is full.
If CONB is less than ELIG, then payment is partial (CONB can never be greater than ELIG).

The loan position is a portion of your total eligible position. Therefore, regardless of the lending program, the client/IM is eligible for the corporate action on the shares available at the Custodian as well as the shares out on loan.

December 2022

The recommendation is to report the following balances; Total Eligible, Settled Position, and Balance on Loan. In this scenario, the client's total eligible position for the Corporate Action is 400 units. The LOAN balance is used to identify that 150 units of the client's total eligible position are out on loan. Therefore, the position available with the Custodian is 250 units.

Recommendation Finalized September 2008 Conference ­ Report total eligible position, total settled position, and balance on loan.

3.3.8.2 MT565 Instruction format
The MT565 does not currently support an instructed loan quantity. However, the message does support the LOAN balance. At this time there is no consensus within the groups to recommend the client/IM to identify the LOAN balance on the MT565. Therefore, identifying the total eligible position on the MT565 is sufficient regardless of the lending program.

Recommendation Finalized June 2008 Conference - Depending on the loan program, loan activity can be transparent to the IM and therefore, they will respond on the total eligible position using 36B::QINS Quantity Instructed on the MT565.

3.3.8.3 MT566 Confirmation of Payment format For payment confirms, there are two scenarios to consider:
1. The shares stayed out at the lending agent/borrower during the event. 2. The shares on loan were returned to the custodian in time for the event.
Recommendation Finalized September 2008 Conference - A Service Provider will report confirmation of loan payments using tag 93B LOAN. The below examples take into account 93B CONB (balance for which the payment applies). As the source of income is different when shares are out on loan as when they are held in custody, the posting dates of the payment could be different. Therefore, two separate MT566 messages should be sent.

3.3.8.4 Business Case A - Mandatory Dividend Third Party Securities Lending Agent (Non-Custody) or Securities Lending Agent (Custody) did not return 150 shares that were out on loan to the custodian. The paying agent allocated payment to the Custodian based on the settled position of 250 shares. And the Securities Lending Agent will allocate payment to the Custodian based on the loan balance of 150 shares.
Custodian receives payment from both sources and allocates to the clients account. The timing of the payment could be different; therefore 2 separate 566 payment confirms would be transmitted by the custodian.

3.4.1 Guidelines for US Lottery Event Processing
3.4.1.1 Overview
This section details US Market practice principles regarding lottery based events. The document will describe general market practice principles for lottery events as well as specific rules per usage of each ISO20022 Corporate Action message used in the lottery full lifecycle flow. These principles are being driven by the DTCC's Corporate Actions Transformation initiative. The SR2014 approved changes related to Lottery processing are also documented within this paper. Please note that this market practice is based upon the SR2014 standards implementation in November 2014 and thus is not in effect until such changes are in production. Please also note that the eight messages which are documented as part of the lottery message flow are meant to be used together. The market practice rules implied in this document assume that the sender of such messages will utilize all messages outlined in this flow.

3.4.1.2 General Market Practice Principles for Lottery Events
· US Lottery based events occur for both DRAW and PDEF events.
· PDEF events can be either Partial Pre-refunding or Partial Defeasement. Both of these events involve no cash payout as they debit the underlying CUSIP and credit two new CUSIPs.
· Partial Defeasement events will result in the debit of the underlying CUSIP and the credit of 2 new CUSIPS for the defeased (called portion) and non-defeased (remaining after lottery). SR2014 introduces a new qualifier within the Securities Movement Section of the CANO / MT564. This indicator will be within the New Securities Issuance Indicator and will be either DEFE for the defeased CUSIP or NDEF for the non-defeased CUSIP.
· Partial Pre-refunding event will debit the underlying CUSIP and the refunded (called portion) is moved to a new CUSIP with an earlier maturity date. The non-refunded (remaining balance after lottery) is moved to a new CUSIP with the existing maturity date as the original underlying CUSIP. SR2016 introduces a new qualifier within the Securities Movement Section of the CANO / MT564. This indicator will be within the New Securities Issuance Indicator and will be either REFU for the Refunded CUSIP or NREF for the Non-Refunded CUSIP (similar to the Partial Defeasement changes introduced for SR2014)
· All accounts that are notified of eligibility in a lottery event via the CANO-Eligible message, or the MT564 should be notified of the lottery results via the CAPA lottery results or MT564 regardless of whether their accounts were affected by the Lottery.
· Clients with "short" position after the Lottery will be notified utilizing Obligated Balance within Lottery results message via the CAPA or MT564 Message.
· Supplemental Lottery events occur when an issuer calls an additional amount for the CUSIP with the same Publication Date, Rate and Payment Date. Supplemental lotteries for DRAW events will always be performed under the same Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF).
· Supplemental Lottery Events for PDEF will occur under the existing Official Corporate Action Identifier only if the Original Lottery has not been run. If an original lottery has been run (CAPA or MT564 REPE received) and a supplemental lottery announcement is received, a new Official Corporate Action Identifier will be used to announce the supplemental event as the prior underlying CUSIP has been debited (exited) and will not be used for such an event. The underlying CUSIP for this Supplemental scenario will be the non-defeased CUSIP (Partial Defeasement event) or the non-refunded CUSIP (Partial Pre-refunding) as both contain the unaffected balance from the original lottery.
· Concurrent Lotteries can occur for the same CUSIP whereby two or more lotteries are run with the same publication date but for different rates. Because of the different terms, two events are created with different Official Corporate Action IDs (COAFS).
· The Event Stage Code will be utilized for Lottery events to identify non-standard lottery status across the lifecycle messages. Such scenarios involve Reversal / Reruns or Supplemental Rescissions only. This field must be assessed along with the Lottery Type (Original / Supplemental) to understand the context of the message. For instance, a Supplemental (SUPP) lottery type with a PART Event stage code means that only the supplemental lottery is being re-

117

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

run. There are three possible values within the Event Stage for Lottery processing which will be described within the message rules section in this document:
o FULL - Cancellation and Re-Run of an Original lottery or an Original and Supplemental Lottery. A subsequent lottery will be performed under a new Event (new COAF)
o PART - Cancellation and Re-Run of Supplemental Lottery only. A subsequent new Supplemental lottery will performed under the Original Event (same COAF )
o RESC - Supplemental Lottery is being cancelled by the issuer. No subsequent lottery will be performed
· The Lottery Type field is also being added for SR2014 across all messages in the lottery flow. This field will help distinguish on Eligible Balance messages involving Supplemental Lotteries that the Eligible Balance is for the Supplemental Lottery. As well, for payments, the Lottery type will help clarify when there is an original and supplemental payout which is from the original and which is from the supplemental lottery.

3.4.1.3 Message rules for Lottery Flow 3.4.1.3.1 Corporate Action Announcement (CANO / MT564)
· The Corporate Action Notification (CANO) for lottery events contain the following key fields: o Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF) o Corporate Action Reference Number (CORP) o Results Publication Date o CUSIP (underlying) o Record Date o Lottery Date o Payment Date o Generic Cash Price Received Per Product (Rate) o Lottery Type (Original / Supplemental) o Base Denomination o Incremental Denomination o Accrued Interest (if applicable) o Premium (if applicable)
· For DRAW events, a supplemental lottery will be run under the same COAF but with the Lottery type supplemental (SUPP). The CANO announcement of a supplemental lottery will be a Replacement (REPL) message.
· For PDEF events, a supplemental lottery will be performed under a new Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF) with new announcements if the original lottery has already occurred. Because the original underlying CUSIP has been moved into new two new CUSIPS (either Refunded / NonRefunded or Defeased / Non-Defeased) there cannot be a supplemental announcement based on the original underlying CUSIP.
118

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

· Event Stage ­ The event stage would be used within an announcement message to indicate that a Supplemental Call is being cancelled (RESC). The Lottery Type field within this scenario would be Supplemental (SUPP). The combination of these two fields indicates that ONLY the supplemental portion is being rescinded and the original lottery is valid. This is the only scenario involving the Event Stage within the CANO or MT564.
· Reversal Rerun of DRAW / PDEF and CANO ­ If the key terms of a DRAW or PDEF event change, the lottery event will be withdrawn (WITH) using a CACN or MT 564 and a new event will be announced with a NEW Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF).
o For PDEF (Partial Defeasance or Partial Pre-refunding ) events, an event would be withdrawn if the refunded amount is less than the original refunded amount (called amount).
o For DRAW events, if the redemption date, publication date or amount (if less than original called amount) changes from the original notification, then the event is reversed and re-run under a new COAF.

3.4.1.3.2 Corporate Action Notification Eligible Balance (CANO-E / MT564)
· The CANO-Eligible Balance Message is a subset of the CANO message with its sole purpose to provide the eligible balance per account before the lottery has occurred. The following key balance fields will be present: o Eligible Balance o Settlement Position Balance o Pending Receipt and/or Pending Delivery Balance. Please note the depository for the US market does not supply pending receipt or delivery balances.
· For ISO20022, the CANO-Eligible message should follow the CANO message in the lottery flow. · Bulking - The CANO-E message or MT564 can be bulked for DRAW or PDEF events to provide one
message with repetitive account balance information pre-lottery. Please see existing US Market Practice rules for bulking. Also, this is an optional market practice to be determined by Service Level Agreement between sender and receiver of the MT564 or CANO-E message.
o Please see Lottery Appendix C for example illustrating how a CANO-E message for accounts AAA, BBB and CCC have separate eligible balances for COAF 76658662 CUSIP 54626XAH1.
· The CANO-E message will always display the Lottery type (Original / Supplemental). · For Supplemental lotteries, the CANO-E will announce the lottery type as SUPP meaning that the
eligible balance is now what is eligible to be called after the Original lottery has occurred. The unaffected balance (uncalled portion) from the CAPA lottery results will become the Eligible balance for the Supplemental Lottery. For example:

3.4.1.3.3 Corporate Action Preliminary Advice (CAPA / MT564)
The Corporate Action Movement Preliminary Advice (CAPA, MT564) message will serve two purposes for Lottery Events: (1) display lottery results and (2) provide preliminary advice of cash / security allocation based upon lottery results. Please note that security allocation will occur only for PDEF (Partial Defeasement or Partial Prerefunding events only).
The CAPA message will contain the following balances:
· Eligible Balance · Affected Balance · Unaffected Balance (portion not called) · Obligated Balance (portion of called balance that account owner is obligated to redeem but not
currently present within their settlement balance (short).

3.4.1.3.3.1 Example: Partial Call Lottery Results with an Obligated Balance
This scenario happens when an account is eligible for the lottery based on the (Results Publication Date ­ 1) position. However, the account does not have position when the lottery is run. This is due to a client trading a position before publication date with settlement occurring after publication date. The Eligible Balance of 100 units is called (affected) but since there is no Settled Balance, the account is Obligated for 100 units.

· A lottery results message should not be sent unless an account has received a CANO-E eligibility notice of the lottery.
· For DRAW events, the CAPA / MT564 message will display the projected cash movement as well as the debit movement of the underlying CUSIP based on the affected balance of the given account number.

120

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

· For PDEF events, there will be no cash movement as both Partial-Refunding and Partial Defeasement events involve the debit of the underlying CUSIP into two new CUSIPS.
· Bulking ­ Lottery results can be supported in a bulk announcement. The bulked lottery results message (CAPA, MT564) would provide one message per receiving BIC that displays the lottery results of all eligible accounts received on the CANO-E message. Each account balance would display. Please see Lottery Appendix D for example. Also, this is an optional market practice to be determined by Service Level Agreement between sender and receiver of the MT564 or CAPA message.
o Eligible Balance
o Affected Balance
o Unaffected Balance
o Obligated Balance
· Lottery Scenarios involving CAPA / MT564 message o If an event is cancelled after the lottery results have been published but before allocation, the Corporate Action Preliminary Advice of Cancellation (CAPC )message must be sent as well as a CACN event cancellation / MT564 23G::WITH.
o If a lottery event is cancelled after it has allocated (CACO - Corporate Action Confirmation) a CAPA message must be sent as a pre-advice of reversal (Corporate Action Reversal - CARE).
o If an original lottery has allocated (CACO) and needs to be reversed and rerun, a CAPA / MT 564 pre-advice must be sent indicating the Event Stage- FULL. The event stage signifies that the lottery results are being fully reversed and a new lottery will be run under a new Corporate Action Event ID (COAF). The CAPA message will also be the pre-advice of CARE allocation reversal advice.
o If an Original and Supplemental both need to be cancelled, there should be two CAPA messages which are a pre-advice of the Original and Supplemental reversals which need to occur.

3.4.1.3.4 Corporate Action Movement Preliminary Advice Cancellation (CAPC / MT564)
The Corporate Action Preliminary Advice Cancellation (CAPC) message is used within the lottery flow whenever lottery results have been published through a CAPA / MT564 and either a reversal or cancellation of the lottery occurs before the lottery has allocated. The following scenarios occur with the CAPC:
· The CAPC message will be used when a lottery has been run (CAPA) and then the event is cancelled before the lottery allocates. The CAPC message will cancel the lottery results and projected movements and a CACN event withdrawal message would also be sent withdrawing the event.
· A CAPC message will be used when a lottery has been run (CAPA/ MT564 23G::REPE) and the event needs to be reversed and rerun before the lottery has allocated. In this case the CAPC
121

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

message would use the Event Stage Code FULL to indicate that the lottery results are being cancelled and a new event (COAF) will be utlized to re-run the lottery. A client should expect an event withdrawal (CACN / MT564 ) message of the original event.
· A CAPC message will be used when a Supplemental Call is being cancelled after a lottery is run but before it has allocated. The CAPC message would indicate an Event Stage Code RESC and a Lottery Type of SUPP. The receiver of the message will receive no further message as only the Supplemental lottery is being cancelled and the Original lottery is valid.
· A CAPC message will be used when a Supplemental lottery has run but needs to be reversed preallocation. The client should receive a CAPC message with an Event Stage code PART indicating that only the Supplemental Call needs to be reversed. A new supplemental lottery will be rerun under the existing Official Corporate Action id (COAF).
· A CAPC lottery cancellation message should not be output unless there has been a CAPA lottery results message which has been output.

3.4.1.3.5 Corporate Action Movement Confirmation (CACO / MT566)
The Corporate Action Movement Confirmation Advice (CACO / MT566) is utilized in the lottery message flow to indicate the settlement of security or cash movements resulting from the lottery redemption. Several key points regarding the usage of this message in the flow:
· As per SR2014, the CACO message will now relate the Lottery Type within the message. This field will provide more clarity to understand when there are multiple allocations resulting from an original and supplemental lottery.
· The lottery type field will also clarify the payouts when an original and supplemental lottery allocate with separate allocations. There will be two movement confirmation messages (CACO / MT566) indicating one having a lottery type of ORIG and the other SUPP.
· The CACO / MT566 message should indicate for DRAW scenarios a debit of the underlying CUSIP along with the credit of Cash.
· CACO / MT566 messages for Partial Pre-refunding and Partial Defeasement events will be security movements only. There will be three security movements for these scenarios with a debit of the original CUSIP and two security credits for the NEW CUSIPS.
· The CACO / MT566 message can be used to output multiple securities movements within the same message for PDEF events. Because the Securities debit of the underlying CUSIP and the Securities credit movement of the two new CUSIPS are known together, one CACO / MT566 message with multiple movements can be used to convey the three transactions.
· Partial Defeasement CACO / MT566messages as per SR2014 will now utilize the New Security Issuance Indicator to indicate DEFE for the defeased CUSIP and NDEF for the non-defeased CUSIP.
· For Partial Pre-refunding CUSIPS, each new security should indicate the maturity date of the new security as the refunded new CUSIP will have an earlier maturity date than the non-refunded CUSIP.

122

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

· For DTCC events involving Partial Call Conversions or Partial Mandatory Puts with or without the right to retain, the allocation of a DRAW event will be to a contra CUSIP.

3.4.1.3.6 Corporate Action Movement Reversal Advice (CARE / MT566)
The Corporate Action Movement Reversal Advice is utilized within the lottery flow to indicate that a reversal or cancellation of the lottery is occurring post allocation. The CARE message in this scenario would have been preceded by a CAPA pre-advice message advising when the security or cash reversals will occur. Several key points regarding the use of the CARE message:
· For SR2014, the CARE message will now indicate the Lottery Type and the Event Stage. In combination these two fields explain why the reversal is occurring.
· For an original lottery being fully reversed, the lottery type ORIG and the Event Stage FULL would be utilized. This would indicate that the lottery will be fully reversed and rerun under a new Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF)
· For an original lottery which is cancelled after allocation, the Lottery Type ORIG will be used but no Event Stage code will be used. The lottery allocations are being fully reversed but the event has been cancelled. This message will be sent in conjunction with a CACN event withdrawal message. When a supplemental call has allocated but is being cancelled, a CARE message will be sent indicating a lottery type of SUPP and an Event Stage of RESC. The lottery proceeds from the supplemental lottery are only being reversed. The original lottery results are valid.
· When a supplemental call has allocated but is being reversed / rerun, a CARE message will be sent indicating a Lottery type of SUPP and an Event Stage of PART. This indicates that only the supplemental call results are being reversed and another supplemental lottery will be run within the same Official Corporate Action ID.

3.4.1.3.7 Corporate Action Cancellation Advice (CACN / MT564)
The Corporate Action Cancellation Advice is used within the lottery workflow to indicate the cancellation of a lottery event. There are several key points concerning the CACN / MT564 message:
· The CACN message will utilize the Event Stage field to indicate when an event cancellation is occurring because of a full reversal (FULL). This situation can occur if either the Original Lottery will be reversed and rerun under a new COAF ID or the Original AND Supplemental lottery are both being reversed and rerun under a new COAF ID.
· The CACN message should link using the Event Linkage section to the new event being created.

123

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

3.4.1.3.8 Corporate Action Event Processing Status Advice (CAPS / MT567)

The Corporate Action Event Processing Status Advice message is used to convey Lottery events in which no payment was received on or after payment date. This message is not part of the lifecycle flow. However, the status advice can be used to indicate lottery events

· The CAPS / MT567 Event Processing status message will be used only for DRAW events. PDEF events do not involve Cash and will always allocate on payment (settlement date).
· The Processing Status would be Pending and the Reason Code would be NPAY (no payment).

3.4.1.4 Lottery Appendices 3.4.1.4.1 Lottery Appendix A. Key Definitions
Concurrent Call - Two (2) Partial calls announced with the same Redemption and/or Publication dates, but different rates. Contra CUSIP is required in this scenario (currently, CONTRA CUSIP is used only if it is a late announcement. Otherwise, 2nd Redemption will be processed once the 1st Redemption is mainlined).
Eligible Balance - Total Eligible balance based on Publication Date -1
Event Stage - ISO field used to further indicate the workflow stage of reversal / rerun or lottery cancellation scenarios. Three values are utilized for lottery events: FULL, PART and RESC
· FULL ­ An Original or An Original and Supplemental lottery are being fully reversed and rerun. A new Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF) will be used to announce the new event.
· PART ­ Used in combination with the lottery type code, PART indicates that only the Supplemental portion of a lottery is being reversed and rerun. This would occur under the existing Official Corporate Action Identifier (COAF)
· RESC - The Supplemental lottery is being cancelled only. No subsequent supplemental lottery will be performed.

Lottery Reversal / Rerun - Key terms of the lottery have been changed by the issuer which will result in the unwinding of the lottery results previously announced. A new lottery announcement will occur under a new Official Corporate Action Identifier.
Partial Defeasance ­ event takes place when the trustee or escrow agent takes action to ensure future payment for the sum defeased to maturity.
Partial Pre-Refunding - event takes place when the issuer, trustee or paying agent hold funds in escrow for a portion of funds to pay some of the security on a scheduled date before the original maturity date.

124

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

Supplemental Call ­ issuer calls additional quantity for the CUSIP with the same Publication Date, Rate and Payment Date. Supplemental calls for Partial Call events (DRAW) are processed with the same Official Corporate Action Identifier. Supplemental Calls for Partial Pre-refunding or Partial Defeasance events are only processed under the same COAF id if the lottery has not yet been run. Otherwise, the supplemental call would be run under a new COAF.

In the example below, three accounts are included in the notification of lottery results. These are the same three accounts shown in the CANO-e example above: AAA, BBB and CCC. In this example, AAA was called for 100,000 (affected balance) leaving an unaffected balance of 325,000. Account BBB was called for 50,000 (affected balance) leaving an unaffected balance of 250,000. Account CCC was called for 50,000 (affected balance) but because the settlement position balance was zero, the account has an obligated balance of 50,000.

3.4.2 Guidelines for US Dutch Auction Event Processing
3.4.2.1 Messages: · MT 564 for the notification · MT 565 for the instructions of options 1, 2, 3 and 6 · MT 567 for the instruction processing statuses of instructions of options 1, 2, 3 and 6 · MT 566 for tender successful for instruction option 1

3.4.2.2 Definition: An action by a party wishing to acquire a security. Holders of the security are invited to make an offer to sell, within a specific price range. The acquiring party will buy from the holder with lowest offer.
3.4.2.3 Issue: ISIN US42822Q1004
3.4.2.4 Terms: Offer to purchase for cash up to 8,000,000 shares of its class A, class B and class C common stock in a "modified Dutch Auction" at a purchase price not in excess of USD 31.50 nor less than USD 29.00 per share in increments of USD 0.25.
Option 1: tender at a specified price
Elect to tender at a price not to exceed USD 31.50 and not less than USD 29.00 per share in bid increments of USD 0.25. This option is subject to pro-ration if more than 8,000,000 shares are tendered.
Option 2: tender at an unspecified price
Shareholders may tender without specifying a price, thereby maximizing their chance to participate in the tender offer. These shareholders will receive the price specified by the company and this price will be paid to all tendering shareholders who properly tendered their shares. This option is subject to proration if more than 8,000,000 shares are tendered.
Options 3 and 4: conditional tender
Shareholders may tender subject to the condition that a specified minimum number of the shares of the total share amount tendered is accepted by the offerer. The purchase may, if necessary to purchase the desired number of shares, purchase shares conditionally tendered (for which the condition was not initially satisfied and regarded as withdrawn), by lot. This option is subject to pro-ration if more than 8,000,000 shares are tendered. For example, if a beneficial owner wishes to tender 500 shares on the

133

Corporate Actions Market Practice Guidelines

December 2022

condition that a minimum of 300 shares is accepted, if fewer than 300 shares after pro-ration are accepted, then the holder will not tender any shares.

For this event, conditional tenders can be made either at a specified or unspecified price.

Options 5 and 6: tender as an odd lot holder

Shareholders who own fewer than 100 shares and who validly tender all of the shares owned will be purchased totally at the purchase price (either specified or unspecified) and will be exempted from proration. This is reflected in the event by the front end lot quantity (FOLQ) of 99 shares. Odd lot shareholders cannot tender conditionally.

The offer is not conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered. The offer is, however, subject to other conditions pursuant to the offer to purchase for cash.

The offer, withdrawal rights and pro-ration period will expire at midnight on 16 March 20YY. The response deadline is 11 March 20YY. Protect period: three NYSE trading days

3.4.2.5 Instruction description: Four instructions are shown:

1. Instruction for option 1 ­ tender with a specified price 2. Instruction for option 2 - tender without a specified price 3. Instruction for option 3 ­ tender conditionally at unspecified price 4. Instruction for option 6 ­ tender with odd lot preference at unspecified price

3.4.2.6 Relative details and dates: Response deadline date ­ 11 March 20YY Cash payment date ­ 24 March 20YY
3.4.2.7 Messages: · MT 564 for the notification · MT 565 for the instructions of option 1 · MT 567 for the instruction processing statuses of instructions of option 1 · MT 566 for tender successful for instruction option 1
