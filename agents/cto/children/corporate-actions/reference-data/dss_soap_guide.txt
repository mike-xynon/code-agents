About this Guide

In this Chapter: · How to Use this Guide · Service and Support · Feedback · Your Personal Information

DataScope Select SOAP API is a request-and-retrieve web service that provides entitled users access to a wide range of DataScope Select content. It consists of multiple web methods for searching and validating instruments and legal entities, accessing data dictionaries, and executing extractions. The DataScope Select API is both language and platform independent and provides flexibility and easy integration of Refinitiv data into your own internal systems.
This guide is one of a three-volume set for programming with the DataScope Select SOAP API. It provides detailed information specific to DataScope Select Web Services Description Language (WSDL), including Message Structure, the Extraction Service, WSDL Operations, and Common Data Types for working with the WSDL.
Further information on working with the API in your development environment is provided in the following two guides:
· DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide Overview
This guide introduces the DataScope Select API and describes the content and features that you can access with it. Instructions for downloading and installing the DataScope Select API Sample Code for Microsoft Visual C# are also provided, along with a best use scenario for requesting and retrieving content via the API.

· DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide for the C# Environment
This guide provides detailed information specific to programming with DataScope Select in a C# environment, including Construction of C# Clients, Creating the C# Project, Objects and Methods, Programming Considerations and Handling Errors.

The guides can be used alone or in combination, depending on your level experience and programming needs. If you are new to the DataScope Select API, you are encouraged to review the DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide Overview to learn about DataScope Select content and the API's capabilities for requesting and retrieving it. If you are an experienced API user, you may choose to start with the DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide for the C# Environment as well.
Note: You are encouraged to explore the REST API as a replacement for the SOAP API. Introduced in DataScope Select 10.1 as the next-generation web service API, the REST API offers expanded content and functionality over the SOAP API. Since the launch of the REST API, all new API functionality in DataScope Select has since been designed around REST.

About the DataScope Select SOAP API

In this Chapter:
· DataScope Select SOAP API Overview
· Usage Scenarios
· ExtractionServiceClient Web Methods
· SOAP API Access & Authentication

This chapter introduces DataScope Select SOAP API and describes the content and features that you can access with it. The basic concepts of the API are covered, along with the best use scenarios..

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 6 of 252

DataScope Select SOAP API Overview
The SOAP API provides platform-independent integration with DataScope Select content and services based on web services technology and XML-based messaging and content. It consists of multiple web methods for searching and validating instruments and legal entities, accessing data dictionaries, and executing extractions, ensuring a reliable and managed replication of Refinitiv pricing and reference content into your own database applications.
Most, although not all, of the content and functionality available in DataScope Select Web Application is available in the SOAP API.
Clients can be written in a desired programming language, for example, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Java, Cocoa. However, Refinitiv supports only C#.
Refinitiv provides a sample client Visual C# solution -- the DataScope Select API Samples (see the DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide Overview) that illustrates the use of all the methods in the API. Sample API client code is available for use in testing and developing your own client programs. The API Samples can be run from the provided console or GUI program. The code for the API Samples can be debugged to help in creating your client program or used in your client program.
Usage Scenarios
The SOAP API offers programmatic access to Refinitiv content in a way that is more flexible than the browser- and FTPbased data access solutions currently available via DataScope Select. It can be used to create an infinite number of client applications and is ideally suited for the following uses:
· Forward Feed for a Client Data Store
Clients who are interested in Refinitiv pricing and reference content may want to replicate DataScope Select data into their own data stores (database, spreadsheet, files). The SOAP API can support this on a securityby-security basis or in client-based lists (portfolios, indexes, funds, etc.).
· Application Data Source
Desktop applications in the securities business need a data source to populate data fields and graphs. Given the breadth of the reference and pricing data available via DataScope Select, the API is an ideal choice to fit this requirement. The API can be used to look-up and display security data in a Windows or web application.
· Embedded DataScope Select
The API will facilitate a high level of control and automation. If you want to fully automate your interaction with DataScope Select, the API is perfectly suited to this requirement. For example, if a fund manager buys a new security, he can use an API-based program to look-up the security and obtain the required pricing and reference data, and then store that information in a database spreadsheet or in-house application within seconds of making the decision. For clients with overnight processing requirements, the API can facilitate automated data retrieval, error processing, and alerting.

SOAP API Access & Authentication

To access the API, new clients are required to login to the DataScope Select user interface and set their user preferences. Failure to do so can result in the following error message:

User with ID XXXXX has not yet activated their account

To access your user preferences, click on your user name, and then select Preferences. Once you save your preferences, you will be able to access the API. See the Validation section to learn about preference settings and their effect on Validation and Extraction processes in the API.

The API is available over the public Internet and via a Refinitiv approved private network, providing access to a Web Service Description Language (WSDL) document and associated web methods.

URLs to access the DataScope Select server through the public Internet:

Endpoint URL https://hosted.datascopeapi.reuters.com/datascopeapi/v1/extractionservice.asmx

Note:

Resilience plans do not support DataScope Select access via IP addresses. In the event of a data center failure and failover, Domain Name System (DNS) changes will begin to direct traffic to servers with different IP addresses. To avoid loss of access under this scenario, please ensure that you access DataScope Select using the published URLs.

If you still require IP addresses (to configure your firewall, for example), please note that DataScope Select uses several IP addresses to maintain connectivity and resilience over the Internet or over a Refinitiv approved private network. This connectivity allows for outbound and inbound traffic to our servers via public or private networks. In order to maintain required connectivity, we ask clients to ensure that firewalls are allowing two-way traffic for HTTPS, SFTP and FTP against the IP addresses available in PCN 6101.

Note:

In order to protect against the potential for network connectivity issues, it is strongly recommended that retries are coded into your processing logic. The "RetrySample" sample program demonstrates how to code for retries when a call to the service is unsuccessful. See "About the API Samples" in the DataScope Select SOAP API Programmer Guide Overview.

The WSDL is an XML document that defines the DataScope Select SOAP API service (`ExtractionService'). It specifies the location of the ExtractionService and exposes the operations that can be performed (`methods'). Data requests and responses are formatted as XML and are exchanged using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).
By default, Refinitiv supports client development on Microsoft Windows using Microsoft's Visual C# 2010 or later. Access to DataScope ExtractionService requires user authentication to verify that you are a valid DataScope Select user with API permissions. Your DataScope Select user name and password are used to access the API. This is the same information that you use to login to the DataScope Select user interface.

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 14 of 252

Authentication Handling
Authentication is handled in Microsoft Visual C# 2010 or later as follows:
· For each call to the API, an instance of the CredentialsHeader class is created and populated with your DataScope Select user ID and password (this is the same user ID and password that you use to access the DataScope Select GUI) and, after the first call, with an AuthenticationToken value, which is valid for 24 hours. This passes authentication information to the API via a special SOAP header.
· When the first web method call returns, the referenced CredentialsHeader object will be populated with an AuthenticationToken value. This token is used to authenticate the client on successive calls referencing the same instance of CredentialsHeader. Each call returns a potentially new credential header, which should be used for subsequent calls. After 24 hours a token will expire, but a new token will be issued and returned with the call.

This chapter describes how to use the DataScope Select SOAP API to construct a client program

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 16 of 252

Proxy Object for ExtractionServiceClient
For maintenance of the proxy object for the ExtractionServiceClient class, it is a recommended best practice to create the object as the entry point into the API and store as a local variable for subsequent calls to the ExtractionServiceClient class. Note that the DataScope Select Samples Code does not handle this the same way. See About the DataScope Select Samples in the DataScope Select API Programmer Guide Overview for a discussion of this issue. It is also recommended you use separate proxy objects for simultaneous calls to an ExtractionServiceClient method. Due to the structural constraints of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), simultaneous calls to an ExtractionServiceClient method, as can occur in a multithreaded program, may fail if the same proxy object is used.
Validation
DataScope Select API Validation methods retrieve the key identifiers used in performing an extraction of data. The methods ValidateInstruments and ValidateLegalEntities of the ExtractionServiceClient class are used to perform validations. The key identifiers include the AssetId of the ValidatedInstrument class and the EntityId of the ValidatedLegalEntity class. DataScope Select API must validate identifiers prior to executing an extraction. The time for Validation is added to what is required for the extraction. To reduce the time needed for the extraction it is recommended you create, locally store and use your list of validated instruments and legal entities instead of having to revalidate them.
The preferences settings in the DataScope Select GUI are applicable to the API and determine what data may be returned in an extraction. There are no settings in the API to override the settings in the GUI. The following summarizes the settings in the GUI and their effect on Validation and Extraction processes in the API.
The following preferences have an effect on the API Instrument Validation process:
· Allow Import of Inactive Instruments into Instrument Lists
· Allow Import of Open Access Instruments from Real-Time Feed
· Allow Import of Duplicate Items into Instrument Lists
· Allow Import of Duplicate Items into Legal Entity Lists
· Exclude FINR as Pricing Source for Bonds
· Use Exchange Code Instead of Lipper as Mutual Fund Default Source
· Use U.S. Quote when Importing Dual-Listed Instruments
· USA - Use consolidated quote source rather than primary quote source
· Canada - Use consolidated quote source rather than primary quote source The following preferences have an effect on the API Extraction process:
· Return Null Code Values in Extraction Pricing Fields
· Exclude Null Codes For Universal Close Price
· Expand File Codes on Extraction to Include Delisted RICs
· Return Fixed Income Global Snapshot (FIGS) Prices in US 3 & 4 PM Premium Pricing Extractions The following preferences have NO effect on the API Validation and/or Extraction process:
· Allow Import of Unsupported Instruments into Instrument Lists (no unfound instrument gets past the validation process)
· Enable RIC Maintenance Reports (not supported via API)
· Enable Early Partial Delivery of Embargoed Reports (not supported via API)

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 17 of 252

Instrument List
The SearchInstruments and SearchLegalEntities methods of the ExtractionServiceClient class retrieve lists of instruments or legal entities using wildcard characters in the supplied identifiers. No facility is provided for creating and storing instrument or legal entity lists on the DataScope Select API server. It is recommended you use and edit your locally stored instrument lists for quick retrieval so that you do not have to repeat requests with each extraction from the DataScope Select API.
Validation Limitation
When the number of File Codes that are returned in a call to ValidateInstruments with the PerformExpansion member of the InstrumentValidationRequest class set to true, it is currently limited to 70000 expanded instruments (File Codes). If you are requesting these File Codes, we recommend that you limit the number of instruments that you validate on each call, and instead make multiple calls. When the 70000-instrument limit is reached, no other instruments in your request will be validated and one or more error messages will be generated in the UnmappedIdentifierErrors array in the InstrumentValidationResponse object.
Extraction Limitation
There are limits to the number of instruments and legal entities that can be requested in an extraction, the rate at which data for instruments and legal entities may be extracted, and the rate at which extractions are made. Refinitiv reserves the right to adjust these limits at any time.
The limits vary by extraction type. The discoverability methods, GetInstrumentExtractionTypes and GetLegalEntityExtractionTypes return lists of the instrument extraction types and legal entity extraction types, as well as the limits on the number of extractions that can be requested. The members MaximumInstrumentsAllowed and MaximumLegalEntitiesAllowed of the classes InstrumentExtractionTypeInfo and LegalEntityExtractionTypeInfo contain these limits. The inherited member Value of these classes indicates the extraction type that is used to select the correct ExtractionRequest object for the extraction.
The rates at which instruments can be extracted are indicated by the following members:
· TimePeriodForLimits indicates the number of seconds in the time-period.
· MaximumInstrumentsAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates the number of instruments that can be extracted in that time-period.
· MaximumExtractionsAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates the number of extractions of instrument data that can be made during the time-periods.
A value of -1 in MaximumInstrumentsAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates that there are no rate limits for instruments or extractions.
There is a 1000 instrument limit in any extraction, with the exception of Intraday Pricing, News Items, , Estimates, Legal Entity Audit and Legal Entity Hierarchy extractions. If your instrument or legal entity list contains more identifiers than the maximum allowed for the indicated extraction type, you can loop through the list, requesting the maximum number of instruments or legal entities.
For Intraday Pricing extractions, you are limited to either 300 extractions or 32000 instruments in a 15-minute period. This means that you must balance the number of instruments in an extraction with the number of extractions. For example, if you extract data for one instrument per extraction, you will only be able to extract data for 300 instruments in a 15-minute period. If you extract data for 1000 instruments in an extraction, you will use only 32 extractions before you reach the 32000 limit.
Limits for instruments per extraction request are 100 for Bond Schedules, MBS - Factor History, Corporate Actions Standard Events and Legal Entity Audit extractions, 1 for Legal Entity Hierarchy extractions, and 10 for Estimates and News Items extractions. News Items extraction responses are also limited to 15,000 rows of data per instrument that, if exceeded, will be returned and reported as truncated in your extraction notes file.
The following members indicate the rates at which data for legal entities can be extracted:
· TimePeriodForLimits indicates the number of seconds in the time-period.
· MaximumLegalEntitiesAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates the number of legal entities that can be extracted during that time-period.

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 18 of 252

· MaximumExtractionsAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates the number of legal entity extractions that can be made during the time-periods.
A value of -1 MaximumLegalEntitiesAllowedPerTimePeriod indicates that there are no rate limits for legal entities or extractions.
Extract Method & the EmptyValue Class
The Extract method returns an object with an array of ExtractionColumn objects. Each ExtractionColumn object contains an array of objects, Values, of the type object. Each ExtractionColumn object also has a member DataType that normally indicates the data type of the objects in the Values array. However, if there is no data available for a particular member of the Values array, the data type of the element will be EmptyValue and the data type indicated by DataType will not be applicable. The program can check for this situation by using the C# "is" operator.
The following code snippet illustrates the usage. "Response" is an ExtractionResponse object:
for(int i = 0; i < response.RowCount; i++) {
foreach (ExtractionColumn ec in response.Columns) {
if (ec.Values[i] is EmptyValue) {
//empty value Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " is null"); } else { //non-empty value switch (ec.DataType)
{ case "Double": double d; d = (double)ec.Values[i]; Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " double: " + d.ToString()); break; case "String": string s; s = (string)ec.Values[i]; Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " string: " + s.ToString()); break; case "Integer": Int32 i1; i1 = (Int32)ec.Values[i]; Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " integer: " + i1.ToString()); break; case "Long": Int64 i2; i2 = (Int64)ec.Values[i]; Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " long: " +

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 19 of 252

i2.ToString()); break;

} }

case "DateOnly": DateTime dd; dd = (DateTime)ec.Values[i] Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " DateOnly: " + dd.ToString());
break; case "DateTime":
DateTime dt; dt = (DateTime)ec.Values[i]; Console.WriteLine(ec.Name + " DateTime: " +
dt.ToString()); break; default:
Console.WriteLine(" Unrecognized Type "); break; }

Wild Cards
There are several conventions governing the behavior of searches when the search string is not specified. This lack of specificity occurs in three ways:
· no string is specified for the search element,
· the search element is specified to be null,
· the search element is specified as "*".
The behavior of the search depends also on whether the member requires a valid non-null value and/or whether there is a discoverability method that provides a list of valid values and/or whether the object is of type Array. The following table lists the combinations and the result. "blank" means that no value is specified for the object. The following table covers the case where the object is not an array.

DataScope Select API ExtractionService Message Structure
The DataScope Select API ExtractServices being bound through the WSDL to SOAP implies that the XML messages sent contain the following elements:
· A required Envelope element that defines the XML document as a SOAP message. · A required Header element that authenticates your DataScope Select API user credentials. · A required Body element that defines the DataScope Select API request and response (the ExtractServices
WSDL operation and its messages). · Fault element that defines error messages that occurred while processing the SOAP request.
Envelope Element
The required Envelope element defines the XML document as a SOAP message. It is uniquely identified with the namespace: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope. The Envelop element is a SOAP standard, as in this sample:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <soap: Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchemainstance"xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
<soap:Header> ... ...
</soap:Header>
<soap:Body> ... ...
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
Header Element
All DataScope Select API ExtractService operations require a Header element that is the first child element of the Envelope element, as in this sample:
<soap:Header> <CredentialsHeader xmlns=" http://reuters.com/datascopeselect/ExtractionService/v1"> <Username>string</Username> <Password>string</Password> <AuthenticationToken>string</AuthenticationToken> </CredentialsHeader>
</soap:Header>
The Header element contains a CredentialsHeader element that is namespace qualified with: http://reuters.com/datascopeselect/ExtractionService/v1. When programming with the DataScope Select SOAP API, you should replace the string placeholders with your actual DataScope Select user name and password. Use the same username and password that you use to login to the DataScope Select GUI.

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 23 of 252

The Authentication Token is generated automatically and is returned with the response. It is not required as part of the Header request.
Your user credentials get carried along the ExtractService operations. When the login timeout period expires, a new authentication occurs without user intervention.

Note:

Every call made has the potential to return a new token, so you should update your locally cached CredentialsHeader with the return of each call. See Authentication Handling on page 15 for more information.

Body Element
The required Body element contains the ExtractionServices operation and messages that constitute the actual SOAP Request and Response. The elements contained in this section are DataScope Select API specific. Their construction is governed by the WSDL. Most of this chapter is devoted to explicating these rules.
ExtractionService Request & Response
The ExtractionService request identifies the instruments, data dictionaries, and extractions to retrieve. All XML requests must conform to the DataScope Select SOAP API WSDL that identifies where the ExtractService web methods are defined. The URL of the WSDL is: https://hosted.datascopeapi.reuters.com/datascopeapi/v1/extractionservice.asmx?wsdl Sample SOAP 1.2 requests and responses for the ExtractService web methods are provided in the next section. Note that only the body elements are shown.
ValidateInstruments
This sample shows a request for an equity instrument identified by its Identifier and IdentifierType and Source. Your request can include multiple instruments. <soap12:Body>
<ValidateInstruments xmlns="http://reuters.com/datascopeselect/ExtractionService/"> <request> <identifiers> <InstrumentIdentifier> <Identifier>.BKCLT</Identifier> <IdentifierType>RIC</IdentifierType> <Source>CBT</Source> </InstrumentIdentifier> </identifiers> </request>
</ValidateInstruments> </soap12:Body>
This sample shows the response for the ValidateIdentifier operation. For each validated instrument, the QuoteID, Asset ID, Segment, ObjectType, RIC and FileCode are returned.
<soap12:Body> <ValidateInstumentsResponse xmlns=" http://reuters.com/datascopeselect/ExtractionService/"> <ValidateInstrumentsResult> <ValidatedInstrument> <Identifier> <Identifier>.BKCLT</Identifier> <IdentifierType>RIC</IdentifierType>

ExtractionService WSDL
This section presents the Extraction Service Web Service Description Language (WSDL) document in a humanreadable form. It clarifies the construction of the messages, elements and complex types of the WSDL messages.
Messages consist of elements. Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) elements are of a specific type. Complex types may be constructed of elements, sequences of elements and sequences of series of elements of other types. Complex type can also be extensions of other complex types. Complex types may be abstract, indicating that elements of this type must be completed by elements of other types that are extensions.
In the following, Element: introduces the name of an element usually of a message. Type: introduces the name of a complex type. These are followed by one or more of the terms: Abstract:, Extension:, Element Attributes:, and Element Type:. Abstract: will be followed by true, indicating that the complex type is abstract. Extension: will be followed by base = ... where..." is filled in with the name of a complex type. This indicates that the complex type is an extension of the type indicated by base =. Element Attributes: define the attributes of the elements in the complex type. Generally, the type = attribute indicates the type of the element.
Many of the complex types contain only one element of another complex type in the same namespace. In these cases, the type of that element is indicated with Element Type: Generally, the next complex type to be described will be this element type. In the case of elements, Element Type: indicates the type of element.
Most of the complex types are associated with one WSDL operation. These complex types will be described immediately after and in conjunction with the description of the operation. A few other complex types are used with multiple WSDL operations. These complex types will be discussed in a separate section.
In the previous chapter, the descriptions of the types of data being passed are associated with C# classes and their members. In this chapter, the descriptions of the types of data being passed will be associated with the XML elements and complex types.
Namespaces
The following namespaces are identified in the DataScope Select SOAP API WSDL document:
xmlns:soap=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/ xmlns:tm=http://microsoft.com/wsdl/mime/textMatching/ xmlns:soapenc=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/ xmlns:mime=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/mime/ xmlns:tns=http://reuters.com/datascopeselect/ExtractionService/v1/ xmlns:s=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema xmlns:soap12=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap12/ xmlns:http=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/http/ xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/">
All unqualified complex types are defined in the WSDL document. The only qualifier used in the following is "s", that is the http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, for the identification of the "simple" types.

Operation: GetVersion
The output message of this operation contains the version of the DataScope Select API available at the current URI and the version DataScope Select that is displayed at the bottom of each web page. The format of the API version is major.minor (for example, 1.2). Major revisions are not backward compatible (for example, version 2.x will not support version 1.x clients). However, minor revisions are backward compatible (for example, version 1.1 will support 1.0 clients). The format of the DataScope Select version is the same as the version number displayed by the DataScope Select website: major.minor.ebf.revision. For example: 4.0.0.1234. This is the only operation in the web service that does not require authentication. Its purpose is to provide a version and it also indicates if the service is running or not. Unlike the other discoverability web methods, GetVersion exists solely for information. It does not provide input information for other web methods in the DataScope Select SOAP API.

Element Description:
Input Message:
The input message is an element of type InstrumentValidationRequest.
The type InstrumentValidationRequest has an element PerformExpansion of type Boolean. A true value for the PerformExpansion element indicates that the output for the ValidateInstruments operation has identifiers for all assets in a File Code identified by a File Code identifier (IPC). Identifiers for assets identified by a chain RIC will not be returned on validation, but will be returned in an extraction.
The IncludeDetails subelement of the InstrumentValidationRequest element is a Boolean indicating that asset type information is being requested. The information is returned in the InstrumentDetail element of the InstrumentValidationResponse element.
The type InstrumentValidationRequest also has an element Identifiers of type ArrayOfInstrumentIdentifier. Its elements are of type InstrumentIdentifier. The InstrumentIdentifier type has three elements: IdentifierType, IdentifierValue, and Source.
The IdentifierValue is a code that identifies the instrument and the IdentifierType indicates the kind of code for the IdentifierValue value. Source is a code identifying the pricing source. It is optional. If it is not set, a default pricing source is returned. The output message of the GetInstrumentIdentifierTypes operation has the possible identifier types.

Note:

The identifier types Market Identification Code (MIC), OCC Code (OCC), RIC Root (RRT), and Ticker (TICKER) are exceptions. They cannot be used for validating an instrument.

Operation: SearchInstruments
The input message of this operation has an element with a base type of InstrumentSearchRequest. The output message of this operation has an element ArrayOfValidatedSearchInstrument. It contains elements of type ValidatedSearchInstrument for the specified instruments. The type ValidatedSearchInstrument has the type ValidatedInstrument as a base. One difference between this operation and the ValidateInstruments operation is the number of identifiers returned. Also, not all instrument types that are valid for ValidateInstruments are valid for SearchInstruments, for example, LIN. Instrument types that are valid for a search are on the list of possible preferred identifier types below. SearchInstruments returns an identifier list for the instrument for each pricing source. It also returns information on the counterparty issuing the instrument. ValidateInstruments returns the identifier list for the instrument for the specified or default pricing source.

Currently there are eight non-abstract types, InstrumentSearchRequestAll, InstrumentSearchRequestCmoAbs, InstrumentSearchRequestEquities, InstrumentSearchRequestFunds, InstrumentSearchRequestFuturesAndOptions, InstrumentSearchRequestGovCorp, InstrumentSearchRequestMortPassThru, and InstrumentSearchRequestUSMunicipals. All of these non-abstract types have the base InstrumentSearchRequest. An element of any of these types is the input message for this operation.
All the non-abstract types have two elements in common: IdentifierSearchValue and IdentifierType. IdentifierSearchValue identifies the instruments being searched for and IdentifierType indicates the type, for example, RIC, of identifier used to identify the instruments. The possible values of the IdentifierType are in the output message of the operation GetInstrumentSearchTypes and are listed in its description.
The IdentifierSearchValue element may be a partial identifier with wildcard characters.

Element Description:
Input Message: The input message of this operation is of type LegalEntitySearchRequest. Currently there is only one non-abstract type, LegalEntitySearchRequestAll, with the base LegalEntitySearchRequest. An element of this type is the input message for this operation. The LegalEntitySearchRequestAll type has two elements: IdentifierSearchValue and IdentifierType. IdentifierSearchValue identifies the legal entity the search is for and IdentifierType identifies the type of identifier used to identify the legal entity. The possible identifier types are in the output message of the GetLegalEntityIdentifierTypes operation. The following table lists these values:

Input Message: The input message for the Extract operation is an element of type ExtractionRequest. It is an abstract type. It has one element, OutputColumns, of type ArrayOfString. The elements of OutputColumns are field identifiers for the desired data. Lists of valid field can be obtained using the Define method. These fields are also listed inDataScope Select Data Content Guide. Since the type ExtractionRequest is an abstract type, a non-abstract type with it as a base is required for the input message element. There are chains of types derived from ExtractionRequest. The non-abstract elements that can be used as a parameter for the Extract operation are:

The following are descriptions of the elements involved in the construction of the input messages for the extract operation:
The abstract type InstrumentExtractionRequest is intermediate between the base type ExtractionRequest and a non-abstract type that is a type of the input message for the operation Extract.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestBondSchedule is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request bond schedules. It is a non-abstract type that is a type of input message for the operation Extract.
The type InstrumentExtractionRequestCoraxStandardEvents type is an input message for the operation Extract. It is derived from InstrumentExtractionRequest. It has elements: CoraxDateConstraint DateConstraint, CoraxEventConstraint[] Events , string[] ShareTypes and string[] ExcludeDeletedEvents. The ShareTypes element is used only if the content of the Event element is SHO. The ExcludeDeletedEvents element takes a true or false value to indicate whether deleted records are excluded from the extraction results.
The Events elements in the array have string members: Constraint and Event.
The DateConstraint element is used to specify the date range for the corporate action event information being extracted. Its value can be an element of one of four types: CoraxDateConstraintDaysDelta, CoraxDateConstraintHoursDelta, CoraxDateConstraintLastUpdated, or CoraxDateConstraintRange each of which is derived from the CoraxDateConstraint. These types permit the specification of the time interval in different ways.
Possible values of the Event element are in the Value element of the ValueInfo parents of the CoraxEventsInfo elements returned by the GetCoraxEvents operation.
The values in the Value and Description elements of the ValueInfo parent element are listed in the following table.

Although the Events element is an array, there are some limitations on its use. The specification of multiple events of the same event type, that is, the same value for the Event element, and different constraints will result in an error. However, one constraint is required. Generally, if data for events of one

DataScope Select ­ SOAP API Programmer Guide WSDL

Page 237 of 252

type but different constraints is desired, the different constraints can be specified in the array OutputFields that is an element of the base type ExtractionRequest of InstrumentExtractionRequest. This specification is independent of the constraint specified in the Events element, that is, any of the possible constraints may be specified.
With a few exceptions, the constraints returned by the GetCoraxEvents() operation for a specific event type are the relevant output fields for an extraction for that event type. One exception is the constraint "All Pending Deals" for the PEO (Public Equity Offerings) event type. Another exception is the SHO (Shares Outstanding). The relevant fields, "Shares Amount", "Shares Amount in Thousands" are not constraints.
The element ShareType is used only when the event type is SHO (Shares Outstanding). Possible content for this element can be obtained using the GetCoraxShareTypes() operation.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestEndOfDay is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the end of day prices for the specified instruments.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestEstimateActual is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the reported earnings of companies. Allowable content for the subelements can be obtained from the GetEstimateDeltaDaysValues, GetEstimateHistoricalRelativeFiscalYearValues, GetEstimateHistoricalRelativeQuarterValues, GetEstimateHistoricalRelativeSemiAnnualValues, and GetEstimateTypes operations.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestEstimateDetail is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the reported earnings of companies. Allowable content for the subelements can be obtained from the GetEstimateTypes, GetEstimateDeltaDaysValues, GetEstimateFutureRelativeFiscalYearValues, GetEstimateHistoricalRelativeQuarterValues, and GetEstimateFuturelRelativeSemiAnnualValues operations. It is not supported in this release.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestFootnoteCompany is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the footnote date for companies.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestFootnoteDetail is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request footnotes on the estimate detail extractions.. It is not supported in this release.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestEstimateSummary is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the estimated earnings of companies. Allowable content for the subelements can be obtained from the GetEstimateTypes, GetEstimateDeltaDaysValues, GetEstimateFutureRelativeFiscalYearValues, GetEstimateFutureRelativeQuarterValues, and GetEstimateFutureRelativeSemiAnnualValues operations.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestIntradayPricing is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the prices during the trading day for the specified instruments.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestMbsFactor is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the monthly factors for mortgage backed securities.
An element of the type InstrumentExtractionRequestNewsItems is an input message for the operation Extract. The element is used to request the financial news items.

Output Message:
The output message of this operation is an element of type ExtractionResponse. An element of type ExtractionResponse has an integer element, the number of rows, RowCount, of data returned, an element, Messages, of type ArrayOfString and an element of type ArrayOfExtractionColumn, OutputColumns. Each element of the element OutputColumns is of the type ExtractionColumn.
The ExtractionColumn type has three elements: DataType, Name and FromInvalidOutputField, of the type string and a general element Values of the type ArrayOfChoice1. DataType indicates the type of data in Values. FromInvalidOutputField has the value true if the output field has been deleted from the public form or is invalid for some other reason. For valid fields it has the value false. If the value of FromInvalidOutputField is true, you can get further information on the problem by checking the Messages sub-element of the ExtractionResponse element of which the ExtractionColumn element is a sub-element.

Common Complex Types
This section details several common types of elements that are used in other elements for multiple operations.

Type: CredentialsHeader
Element Attributes: name = Username; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string Element Attributes: name = Password; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string Element Attributes: name = AuthenticationToken; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string Element Attributes: type = s:anyAttribute;

Type Description:
An element of the type CredentialsHeader is in the SOAP header for almost all operations. The Username and Password elements must have valid data for any of the methods, except GetVersion, to work. The Username and Password are the same as the username and password for the DataScope Select hosted web application. Data for the AuthenticationToken element is returned by the API. When the AuthenticationToken element has valid data, the efficiency of the extraction is enhanced because the API does not need to use the less efficient Refinitiv user validation methods.

Note:

Every call made has the potential to return a new token, so you should update your locally cached CredentialsHeader with the return of each call. See Authentication Handling on page 15 for more information.

Type: OperationInfoHeader
Element Attributes: name = Host; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = ProcessingTime; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:duration
Type Description:
An element of the type OperationInfoHeader is in the SOAP header for returned in the response object by extraction operations. It is primarily used for debugging purposes. The Host element identifies the server the request was processed on. The ProcessingTime element indicates the amount of time required for the extraction.

Type: ValueInfo
Element Attributes: name = Value; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string Element Attributes: name = Description; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;
Type Description: Collections of elements of the ValueInfo type are returned by most of the discoverability methods. The items in the Value element are used as element in input messages for extraction requests. The items in the Description element are for your information.

Type: ArrayOfValueInfo
Element Attributes: name = ValueInfo; minOccurs = 0 maxOccurs = unbounded
Type Description: A collection of ValueInfo elements.

Type: ValidatedInstrument
Element Attributes: name = AssetId;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = FileCode;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = IdentifierType;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = IdentifierValue;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = ObjectType;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = QuoteId;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = Ric;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = RrpsRic;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = Segment;minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1;type = s:string
Element Attributes: name = Source; minOccurs = 0; maxOccurs = 1; type = s:string
Type Description:
Elements of the type ValidatedInstrument contains the validated identifiers returned by the operations ValidateInstruments and SearchInstruments. The member AssetId is the identifier that produces the efficiencies in the extractions. AssetId is an internal Refinitiv identifier. Refinitiv databases are optimized for searches using this id. IdentifierValue is an instrument identifier of type IdentifierType. It can be the usersupplied identifier or identifier of a type. Source is the user-supplied pricing source for the instrument. Some of the instrument identifiers linked to a particular pricing source. The File Code for an instrument is a 4 digit number that identifies a class to which the instrument belongs. QuoteId, Segment, and ObjectType are identifiers used to classify the instrument in Refinitiv database.
The table below lists the possible values for the IdentifierType:

DataScope Select SOAP API Error Messages
Errors from DataScope SOAP API are returned through the SOAP fault mechanism. All SOAP faults returned by the web methods of the API can be divided up into two categories: those caused by client and those caused by the server. A successful web method call will result in an HTTP status code of 200. A web method call that result in a SOAP fault will return an HTTP status code of 500. Other HTTP status codes can be returned (like 400 Bad Request) if the request does not even represent a valid SOAP or HTTP request.
Client Errors
Errors caused by the client will result in a SOAP fault. It is the responsibility of the client to correct the data that caused the error before attempting to send the data again, otherwise the request will continue to fail. There are three distinct causes of a client error. They are:
· Security Error ­ occurs when the CredentialsHeader SOAP header object was missing, an invalid username and/or password were sent in the SOAP header, or the user doesn't have sufficient privileges to access the API.
· Validation Error ­ occurs due to one or more of the following reasons:
· the web method that was called required an object as a parameter and none was passed
· a required property in the parameter (or one of its contained objects) was not populated
· a property in the parameter was populated with an unsupported value
· an obosolete method was called.
· Processing Error ­ a client-caused processing error. A common cause of this error is when a client attempts to perform an extraction against an extraction type for which they don't have permission
When a SOAP fault is returned due to a client error, it will have a SOAP fault code of Client (SOAP 1.1) or Sender (SOAP 1.2). The SOAP fault string (or reason) will contain a message describing what kind of client error occurred. The SOAP fault detail will contain XML that can be deserialized into a ClientError object containing the details of the error.

Server Errors
Errors caused by the server will also result in a SOAP fault. When a server-caused SOAP fault is returned, it can be assumed that no amount of correction of the client request will result in a successful call. Instead, something needs to be corrected on the server side either by operations or the development team. The customer should report the error, along with the Error Instance ID (see the ServerError object description), so that a resolution can be quickly achieved. There are many things that can cause a server error. Some of them include:
· The backend extraction service is too busy servicing other requests. Multiple attempts have been made to perform the extraction, but the maximum number of retries has been exceeded.
· The connection to a required backend resource like a database server or the backend extraction service is down.
· Any other unanticipated error. When a SOAP fault is returned due to a server error, it will have a SOAP fault code of Server (SOAP 1.1) or Receiver (SOAP 1.2). The SOAP fault string (or reason) will contain a message that reads something like:
An unexpected error occurred on the server. The SOAP fault detail will contain XML that can be deserialized into a ServerError object containing the details of the error. ServerError object
· ErrorInstanceId: A value that uniquely identifies the error instance on the server. This ID can be used by operations to look up the error details in the error logs on the server.
· ErrorDetails: This member is not used. o Host: A comma separated list of IP address for the specific host computers.
