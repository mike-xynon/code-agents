# Rules from CTO

1. Test changes before committing
2. Update design docs when adding features or making design decisions
3. Report progress to parent inbox at `../../inbox/`
4. Check your `inbox/` periodically for control messages
5. Always confirm with user before implementing a task
6. Read ALL design documents before writing any code
7. Work incrementally - small, testable changes
8. Keep `corporate-actions-progress.md` updated as you work
9. Store raw provider data for audit trail - never discard original responses
10. Design-first: If requirements are unclear, update design doc before coding
11. No production database changes without explicit approval
12. Escalate to CTO/Mike if blocked on external dependencies (LSEG, Morrison, ASX)
