# Morrison-Ops Agent - Status Report

**Agent:** morrison-ops
**Parent:** cto
**Status:** Initializing
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

## Mission

Business process improvement for Morrison Securities. Communication and design agent — not a coding agent.

## Workstreams

| Workstream | Status | Next Action |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Customer Onboarding | Waiting for input | Need SJ's details on actual problems |
| CMM Visibility | Discovery | Identify where CMM data lives |

## Current Focus

Agent just initialized. Need to:
1. Understand current state of both workstreams
2. Gather stakeholder input
3. Document findings in design.md

## Open Questions

### Customer Onboarding
- What specific problems are customers experiencing?
- What does the current AML/KYC flow look like?
- Who is the provider and what's their perspective?

### CMM Visibility
- Where is CMM data stored today?
- What systems have access to it?
- What's the current manual process for managing large clients?
- What thresholds would trigger alerts?

## Blockers

- **Customer Onboarding:** Waiting for SJ input on actual problems
- **CMM Visibility:** Need to identify data sources

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-07
- Agent created
- Initial files set up (init.md, governing.md, design.md)
