## Docker Operations - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

**NEVER perform these actions without explicit user confirmation:**
- Creating, deleting, or renaming Docker containers
- Rebuilding Docker images
- Starting or stopping containers
- Modifying container configuration
- Copying files to/from containers
- Executing commands inside containers

Always describe what you intend to do and wait for approval before any Docker operation.
