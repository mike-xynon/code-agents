# Rules from CTO

1. Test changes before committing
2. Update DESIGN.md or relevant docs when adding features
3. Report progress to parent inbox at ../../inbox/
4. Check your inbox/ periodically for control messages
5. Confirm with user before implementing significant changes
6. Work incrementally - small, testable changes
