**Subject:** Review repository isolation changes

## Request

I've just completed a significant update to the agent coordination system. Please review the following files and provide any suggestions for improvement:

### Core System Files
- `/shared/state/system.md` — Global conventions, volume structure
- `/shared/state/agents/cto/rules.md` — Operating rules for children
- `/shared/state/agents/cto/repos.md` — Repository list and clone instructions
- `/shared/state/agents/cto/design.md` — Architecture decisions

### Agent Templates
- `children/agent-farm/agent-templates/system.md` — Template for new agents
- `children/agent-farm/agent-templates/cto/repos.md` — CTO template repos

### Infrastructure
- `children/agent-farm/claude-worker/startup.sh` — Now clones to ~/repos/
- `children/agent-farm/DESIGN.md` — Updated architecture docs

## Key Changes Made

1. **Repository isolation** — Each agent now clones repos to private `~/repos/` instead of shared `/shared/repos/`
2. **Removed workspace/** — No longer part of agent folder structure
3. **Reserved /shared/repos/** — Marked as future use only
4. **Added CTO parent files** — meta.md, init.md, governing.md, rules.md, report.md, design.md

## Questions for Review

1. Is the repository isolation pattern clear enough for child agents?
2. Are the clone command examples sufficient?
3. Should we add any additional guidance for agents working across multiple repos?
4. Any gaps in the CTO parent agent documentation?

Please update your `report.md` with your findings and any recommendations.
